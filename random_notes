Cache

When the processor makes a request for memory reference, the request is first sought in the cache. If we get the memory reference that is requested we call it “CACHE HIT” otherwise “CACHE MISS”.

Hit ratio = hit/(hit + miss) = no. of hits/ total access.

When the processor makes a request for memory reference, the request is first sought in the cache. If we get the memory reference that is requested we call it “CACHE HIT” otherwise “CACHE MISS”.

The locality of reference is of two types:

Spatial locality: The adjacent words in the block are referenced by the CPU  in the near future.
Temporal locality: The same word in the block are referenced by the CPU in the near future  

The cache is organized not in bytes but as blocks of cache lines with each line containing the same no. of bytes. (16-64)

Cache lines do not have a fixed address, which enables the cache system to populate each cache line with a unique (non-contiguous) address. 

There are three methods for filling a cache lines

Fully associated - The most flexible.
Direct mapped - The most basic
Self associated - A combination of the two.

Program:
It resides in the secondary storage device
A program consists of instructions in any programming language.
program is a passive entity, which is a file containing a list of instructions stored on a disk (often called an executable file).
A program becomes a process when an executable file is loaded into memory.

Process:
It resides in the main memory
A process consists of instructions in machine code. A program in execution is called a process.
There are two types of processes: I/O bound process and CPU bound process.

Thread:
Thread is the basic unit of execution or CPU utilization. 


Why does thrashing occur?
