what is this ✅ Index Merge (Union)

✅ Index Merge (Union) — Explained Simply
Index Merge (Union) is a query optimization strategy used by some SQL engines (like MySQL) where multiple indexes are used together to satisfy parts of a query condition, especially when the condition involves OR.

🧠 Example Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM T WHERE a = 3 OR b = 4;
📘 Suppose You Have These Indexes:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_a ON T(a);
CREATE INDEX idx_b ON T(b);
🛠 What Happens Internally:
MySQL uses idx_a to find all rows where a = 3.

It also uses idx_b to find all rows where b = 4.

Then it merges the two result sets (like a set union), removes duplicates (if any), and fetches full rows from the table.

This is Index Merge (Union).

🟢 Why It's Useful:
Allows multiple single-column indexes to work together for complex queries.

Avoids full table scan when no composite index can help.

Works best for OR, sometimes for IN.

🔍 Visual View:
text
Copy
Edit
Index idx_a ---> Matches: row_ids_a = {1, 4, 7}
Index idx_b ---> Matches: row_ids_b = {2, 4, 9}

Index Merge (Union):
    row_ids_merged = row_ids_a ∪ row_ids_b = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
Then the engine does a row lookup for each of these.

🚫 Not All Engines Support It
MySQL/InnoDB: Yes (since 5.0).

PostgreSQL: No native Index Merge Union; uses other strategies like bitmap scans.

✅ Summary:
Feature	Description
What it is	Uses multiple indexes and unions their results
When it applies	Mainly on WHERE ... OR ... queries
Requirements	Separate indexes on the relevant columns
Benefit	Avoids full scan, improves performance


in the case of and query , composite indexes are useful



when or is there in te query,    composite index are not of a use, individual indexes are used
