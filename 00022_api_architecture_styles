API Architecture refers to the structure and design of how APIs are built, exposed, and consumed in software systems. It defines the organization of components, communication methods, security, versioning, and governance around APIs.

🔷 Core Components of API Architecture
1. API Gateway
Acts as a single entry point for clients to access multiple backend services.

Responsibilities:

Routing

Authentication & authorization

Rate limiting

Caching

Request/response transformation

✅ Example: AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee

2. Service Layer
The actual business logic behind the API endpoints. These are the microservices or backend systems that handle requests.

Example: Order Service, User Service, Payment Service.

3. Data Layer
Where the actual data lives — databases, caches, external systems.

4. Client
The consumers of the API, which could be web apps, mobile apps, or other services.

🔷 Common API Architectural Styles


| Style          | Description                  | Example                    | Pros                        | Cons                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **REST**       | Resource-based over HTTP     | `GET /users/1`             | Simple, cacheable           | Less suited for complex interactions |
| **GraphQL**    | Query language for APIs      | `POST /graphql`            | Flexible querying           | Harder to cache, security complexity |
| **gRPC**       | Binary RPC over HTTP/2       | `rpc GetUser(UserRequest)` | High performance, streaming | Steeper learning curve               |
| **WebSockets** | Bi-directional communication | Real-time apps             | Real-time updates           | Connection management                |
| **SOAP**       | XML-based protocol           | `<soap:Envelope>`          | Rigid contract, formal      | Heavy, less used today               |



🔷 API Architecture Patterns
✅ 1. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)
Different API layers for different frontends (mobile, web).

Improves frontend-specific optimization.

📘 Example: A mobile BFF handles lower payloads; a web BFF returns richer data.

✅ 2. API Gateway Pattern
Clients call the gateway; gateway routes to services.

Adds security, throttling, analytics, etc.

📘 Example: Netflix Zuul, AWS API Gateway.

✅ 3. Microservice + API Layer
Each microservice exposes APIs directly or via gateway.

Promotes loose coupling and service autonomy.

📘 Example: Uber or Amazon services with domain-specific APIs.

✅ 4. Service Mesh + Sidecars
Uses proxies (sidecars) to manage service-to-service API calls transparently.

📘 Example: Istio, Linkerd in Kubernetes environments.

🔒 API Security Architecture


| Layer            | Mechanism                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Authentication   | OAuth 2.0, JWT, API Key       |
| Authorization    | Role-based, Scopes            |
| Rate Limiting    | Token buckets, quotas         |
| Encryption       | HTTPS, TLS                    |
| Input Validation | JSON schema, parameter checks |



📦 API Versioning Strategies
URI-based: /v1/users

Header-based: Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json

Query param: /users?version=1

📈 Monitoring & Observability
Logging: Request/response logs.

Metrics: Latency, error rates, throughput.

Tracing: Distributed traces (OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, Jaeger).

✅ Example: Modern API Architecture (Microservices)


        +-------------------+
        |    Mobile App     |
        +-------------------+
                 |
        +-------------------+
        |   API Gateway      |  <-- Auth, Rate Limiting, Logging
        +-------------------+
         /        |       \
+---------+  +---------+  +---------+
| UserSvc |  | OrderSvc|  | Payment |
+---------+  +---------+  +---------+
     |            |             |

Composite views (e.g., dashboards)

Mobile apps with slow networks

✅ Pros:
Fewer client-server calls

Better performance and UX

❌ Cons:
Gateway becomes tightly coupled to services

Complex mapping and transformation logic

🔷 4. GraphQL API Pattern
✅ Description:
A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

Here are the most common API architecture styles, each defining how APIs are designed, interact, and communicate:

🔷 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)
✅ Overview:
Based on resources (/users, /orders)

Uses HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Stateless communication

Uses JSON or XML

🛠️ Example:


GET /products/123
POST /orders




✅ Pros:
Simple and widely adopted

Cacheable

Easily understood by developers

❌ Cons:
Over-fetching or under-fetching of data

Not suitable for complex queries

🔷 2. GraphQL
✅ Overview:
Clients specify exactly what data they need

Single endpoint (/graphql)

Uses a typed schema

Supports queries, mutations, and subscriptions

🛠️ Example:
graphql
Copy
Edit



{
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    orders {
      id
      total
    }
  }
}


✅ Pros:
Eliminates over-fetching/under-fetching

Flexible and powerful

Good for frontend teams

❌ Cons:
Caching is complex

Overhead on simple use cases

Potential for performance issues if poorly designed

🔷 3. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
✅ Overview:
Uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for data serialization

Built on HTTP/2

High-performance, binary communication

Strongly typed contracts

🛠️ Example:


rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);




✅ Pros:
Fast and lightweight

Supports streaming

Ideal for microservices

❌ Cons:
Not browser-friendly

Harder to debug and monitor

Requires code generation

🔷 4. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
✅ Overview:
XML-based protocol with strict message structure

Uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language)

Supports transport protocols like HTTP, SMTP

🛠️ Example:
xml
Copy
Edit



<soap:Envelope>
  <soap:Body>
    <GetOrder>...</GetOrder>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>




✅ Pros:
Strong standards and specifications

Built-in security (WS-Security), transactions

❌ Cons:
Verbose and complex

Less common in modern web applications

🔷 5. WebSockets
✅ Overview:
Provides bi-directional, full-duplex communication

Ideal for real-time applications

Keeps a persistent connection between client and server

🛠️ Example Use Case:
Chat applications

Live notifications

Real-time dashboards

✅ Pros:
Real-time communication

Low-latency

❌ Cons:
Not cacheable

Needs extra infrastructure (e.g., connection handling, fallbacks)

🔷 6. JSON-RPC / XML-RPC
✅ Overview:
RPC-based APIs using JSON or XML over HTTP

Each request includes method name and parameters

🛠️ Example:


{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getUser",
  "params": { "id": 123 },
  "id": 1
}



✅ Pros:
Simple RPC pattern over HTTP

Lightweight

❌ Cons:
Lacks RESTful resource structure

No standard for versioning, authentication, etc.
