cap theorem


Consistency  | Availability |  Partition Tolerance


Due to network issues, partition tolerance cannot be avoided.

So we can improve consistency or availability either CP (consistency, Partition Tolernce) or AP (Availability, Partition Tolernce)

Consistency

master to slave updation 

write on master and read from slaves happen


Availability:

Keeping replicas / slaves
