10. Batch Processing


PART III — Derived Data
Context

In the earlier parts of the book (Parts I and II), the discussion was about the fundamentals of distributed databases:

How data is laid out on disk

Fault tolerance and distributed consistency

Query execution

That assumed only one single database in an application.

But in the real world, applications are more complex. They need multiple types of data systems—because one database can’t handle every need efficiently.

So, large-scale applications use a combination of:

Datastores

Indexes

Caches

Analytics systems

ETL pipelines (moving data between systems)

This part of the book (Part III) explores how to integrate multiple systems with different data models and optimizations into a coherent application architecture.

Systems of Record and Derived Data

Data systems can be categorized into two broad types:

1. Systems of Record (Source of Truth)

Holds the authoritative version of the data.

When new data comes in (e.g., user input), it is first written here.

Each fact is stored exactly once (usually in normalized form).

If another system disagrees, the system of record is always correct.

Example:
A relational database storing users, orders, or payments in normalized tables.

2. Derived Data Systems

Data here is transformed or processed from another system’s data.

If lost, it can be recreated from the original system of record.

Examples:

Cache → speeds up reads, but always fallback to the original DB.

Indexes / Materialized Views → derived from source data.

Recommendation engine outputs → derived from logs.

Derived data is:

Redundant (duplicates existing info)

Often denormalized (pre-computed joins, summaries)

Used for performance and different points of view on data

Why This Distinction Matters

Helps clarify system architecture

Makes dataflow explicit (inputs, outputs, dependencies)

Avoids confusion about which system’s value is “correct”

Important note:
A database itself is neither inherently a system of record nor derived. It depends on how you use it.

Overview of Chapters in Part III

SEA OF DERIVED DATA (Diagram Reference)

This part of the book uses a metaphorical map with tools like:

MapReduce, Spark, Flink, GraphX, Solr, ETL workflows, etc.

Showing how systems relate in the world of derived data.

CHAPTER 10 — Batch Processing
Quote

A system cannot be successful if it is too strongly influenced by a single person… — Donald Knuth

Meaning: Systems must evolve through contributions from many perspectives.

Requests vs Batch vs Streams

So far (Parts I & II), focus was on request/response systems (like web apps or APIs). But that’s only one way to process data.

Three main types of systems exist:

1. Services (Online Systems)

Wait for requests from clients.

Respond quickly (response time = key performance metric).

Availability is crucial (users get errors otherwise).

Examples: web servers, APIs.

2. Batch Processing Systems (Offline Systems)

Take large input data, run jobs, produce output.

Jobs take minutes → days.

Scheduled periodically (e.g., daily).

Performance metric = throughput (speed of processing big datasets).

Covered in this chapter.

3. Stream Processing Systems (Near-Real-Time)

Consume continuous events as they happen.

Output quickly (low latency).

Built on ideas from batch processing.

Covered in Chapter 11.

Why Batch Processing Matters

Foundation for reliable, scalable apps.

MapReduce (2004) was revolutionary → scalable on commodity hardware.

Even though its importance has declined (superseded by Spark, Flink, etc.), it’s worth studying because it shows the principles.

Historical Context

Before computers: batch-like processing with punch card machines (e.g., Hollerith machines in 1890 US Census).

1940s–50s: IBM card-sorting machines for business data.

MapReduce is conceptually similar — processing large datasets in structured stages.

History repeats: Old ideas reappear in modern computing.

Batch Processing with Unix Tools
Example: Web Server Logs

Web servers (like nginx) write logs: one line per request.

Log line example:

216.58.210.78 - - [27/Feb/2015:17:55:11 +0000] 
"GET /css/typography.css HTTP/1.1" 200 3377 
"http://martin.kleppmann.com/" 
"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36"


(This is one single line, wrapped here for readability.)

Log Format (nginx default)
$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" 
$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"

Meaning of the Example

IP address: 216.58.210.78 → the client making the request

Remote user: - → no authentication (anonymous)

Time: [27/Feb/2015:17:55:11 +0000] → UTC time of request

Request: "GET /css/typography.css HTTP/1.1" → requested file

Status code: 200 → success

Response size: 3377 bytes sent back

Referer: "http://martin.kleppmann.com/" → page that requested the CSS file

User agent: "Mozilla/5.0 ... Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36" → client browser details






Simple Log Analysis
Building Our Own Analysis

Instead of using specialized analytics tools that produce reports from log files, we can roll our own log analysis using basic Unix tools.

Task: Find the five most popular pages on a website.

Unix Pipeline Command
cat /var/log/nginx/access.log |
awk '{print $7}' |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -r -n |
head -n 5

Step-by-Step Breakdown

Read the log file

cat /var/log/nginx/access.log


Reads the entire access log file.
(Note: cat is technically unnecessary, because you could just give the file directly to awk. But using cat makes the pipeline structure clearer.)

Extract the requested URL

awk '{print $7}'


Splits each line by whitespace.

Prints the 7th field (in nginx logs, this is the requested URL).

Example: /css/typography.css

Sort the URLs

sort


Alphabetically sorts all extracted URLs.

If a URL appears n times, after sorting it will appear n times consecutively.

Count occurrences of each URL

uniq -c


uniq removes duplicate adjacent lines.

The -c option makes it count how many duplicates were collapsed.

Example output:

4189 /favicon.ico
1369 /


Sort by frequency

sort -r -n


-n → sort numerically.

-r → reverse order (largest numbers first).

This puts most frequently requested URLs at the top.

Show top 5 results

head -n 5


Displays only the first 5 lines of the sorted results.

Example Output
4189 /favicon.ico
3631 /2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html
2124 /2012/12/05/schema-evolution-in-avro-protocol-buffers-thrift.html
1369 /
915 /css/typography.css


This shows the five most popular pages, along with the number of times they were requested.

Why This Is Powerful

Even though the pipeline looks cryptic, it’s fast and scalable.

It can process gigabytes of logs in seconds.

It’s also flexible:

Omit CSS files →

awk '$7 !~ /\.css$/ {print $7}'


Count top client IP addresses →

awk '{print $1}'


Tools like awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, xargs allow you to do a surprising variety of analyses with minimal code.

Chain of Commands versus Custom Program

Instead of chaining Unix commands, you could write a program in a language like Ruby.

Ruby Example
counts = Hash.new(0)
File.open('/var/log/nginx/access.log') do |file|
  file.each do |line|
    url = line.split[6]
    counts[url] += 1
  end
end
top5 = counts.map{|url, count| [count, url] }.sort.reverse[0...5]
top5.each{|count, url| puts "#{count} #{url}" }

Explanation

counts = Hash.new(0)

A hash table to count URL occurrences.

Each unseen URL defaults to 0.

line.split[6]

Splits each log line by whitespace.

The 7th field (index 6) is the URL.

counts[url] += 1

Increment the counter for that URL.

counts.map...sort.reverse[0...5]

Convert hash table into an array of [count, url].

Sort in descending order.

Take the top 5.

puts "#{count} #{url}"

Print each of the top 5 results.

Comparison

Unix pipeline → shorter, cryptic, but very efficient.

Ruby program → longer, clearer logic flow, but different execution style.

Sorting versus In-Memory Aggregation

Two approaches:

1. Ruby Hash Table (In-Memory Aggregation)

Keeps a hash table: {URL → count}

Memory usage depends on number of distinct URLs, not number of log entries.

Example:

1M requests to a single URL → only 1 counter in memory.

Works fine if the working set (distinct URLs) fits in memory (say ≤ 1 GB).

2. Unix Pipeline (Sorting-Based)

Does not use a hash table.

Repeats URLs and relies on sorting + uniq.

Sorting can be spilled to disk if dataset > memory.

Uses mergesort → sequential I/O → efficient on disks.

GNU sort automatically:

Spills large datasets to disk

Parallelizes across CPU cores

👉 Advantage: Scales better for very large logs (bigger than memory).

The Unix Philosophy
Key Idea

Unix was designed to make data processing easy by chaining simple tools together.

Doug McIlroy (inventor of pipes) described this in 1964:

“We should have some ways of connecting programs like [a] garden hose—screw in another segment when it becomes necessary to massage data in another way.”

This became part of the Unix philosophy.

Four Principles (1978)

Make each program do one thing well.

Don’t overload programs with features.

Expect program output to become another program’s input.

Keep output clean and simple.

Avoid weird binary or interactive-only formats.

Design for iteration.

Build software quickly, test early, throw away clumsy parts.

Prefer tools over manual effort.

Automate tasks.

Build temporary tools if needed.

Relevance Today

Sounds like Agile and DevOps practices:

Automation

Rapid prototyping

Incremental iteration

Experimentation

Modular design

Example: sort

Does one thing well → efficient sorting.

Better than many programming language libraries:

Can spill to disk for large datasets.

Uses multi-threading when beneficial.

Alone, sort isn’t useful.

In combination with uniq, head, etc., it becomes powerful.

Composability in Unix

Unix shell (e.g., bash) allows small tools (often written by different people) to be joined together.

This composability is why Unix pipelines are so powerful.

The design decisions of Unix (simple text I/O, pipes, modular programs) make it possible.




A Uniform Interface
Compatible Interfaces

For programs to be chained together, their input and output formats must be compatible.

In Unix, this is achieved through a uniform interface: files (technically, file descriptors).

A file = an ordered sequence of bytes.

This abstraction allows very different things to share the same interface:

Files on disk

Communication channels (stdin, stdout, Unix sockets)

Device drivers (/dev/audio, /dev/lp0)

TCP sockets

👉 Because of this uniformity, you can plug programs together easily, regardless of what they are doing.

ASCII Text Convention

By convention, many Unix tools treat the byte stream as ASCII text.

In our log analysis example:

awk, sort, uniq, head → all treat input as lines separated by newline (\n, ASCII 0x0A).

Choice of \n was arbitrary (ASCII record separator 0x1E might have been more “correct”).

But standardization on \n allows interoperability.

Parsing Records

Each record = a line of input.

Splitting into fields is less standardized:

Often split by whitespace or tabs

But also possible: CSV, pipe-separated, etc.

Even a simple tool like xargs has many options to configure how input is parsed.

Limitations of the Interface

Example from log analysis: {print $7} → not very readable.

Ideally, it would be {print $request_url} (named fields).

So, while the text interface works, it’s not perfect.

Significance

Even decades later, the uniform interface of Unix remains remarkable.

Few software systems interoperate as smoothly:

Example: you can’t easily pipe your email + shopping history → analysis tool → spreadsheet → social media.

Even databases with the same model often don’t interoperate easily → leads to data silos (“Balkanization of data”).

Separation of Logic and Wiring
stdin and stdout

Default behavior:

stdin = keyboard input

stdout = screen output

But input/output can be redirected:

Input from a file

Output to a file

Pipes let you connect stdout of one program → stdin of another (in memory, no intermediate file).

Loose Coupling

Programs can still open files or sockets directly, but the Unix approach works best if they just use stdin/stdout.

Advantage:

The shell user can “wire up” the programs however they like.

The program doesn’t care where input comes from or where output goes.

This is like:

Loose coupling

Late binding

Inversion of control

Extensibility

You can easily plug your own programs into Unix pipelines.

Example (in log analysis):

Write a tool to convert user-agent strings → browser names

Or IP addresses → country codes

Insert it into the pipeline, and everything still works.

Other tools (sort, uniq) don’t care what program they are talking to — only that they receive a byte stream.

Limitations

stdin/stdout works great for single input + single output programs.

But multiple inputs/outputs are harder:

Can’t directly pipe output into a network connection (without extra tools like netcat or curl).

If a program opens files, sockets, or subprocesses on its own, the shell has less control.

Still configurable via options, but less flexible than pure stdin/stdout wiring.

Transparency and Experimentation

Why Unix tools succeed: they make it easy to see and experiment with data.

Immutable input files

Commands don’t modify input.

Safe to rerun multiple times with different options.

Inspect intermediate results

Stop a pipeline midway.

Pipe into less to view output.

Great for debugging.

Stage-by-stage restarts

Save output of one stage to a file.

Use it as input to the next stage.

No need to rerun the full pipeline.

👉 This makes Unix tools blunt but amazingly useful for experimentation and debugging.

⚠️ Limitation: They only run on a single machine. That’s why Hadoop/MapReduce were created.

MapReduce and Distributed Filesystems
Concept

MapReduce = like Unix tools, but distributed across thousands of machines.

One job = like one Unix process:

Takes inputs

Produces outputs

Like Unix:

Normally does not modify inputs

No side effects except producing outputs

Input and Output

Unix tools → stdin/stdout.

MapReduce → files on a distributed filesystem.

In Hadoop: that filesystem = HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

HDFS = open source reimplementation of Google File System (GFS).

Other Distributed Filesystems

Examples:

GlusterFS

Quantcast File System (QFS)

Object stores: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, OpenStack Swift

⚠️ Difference:

HDFS = storage + computation locality → jobs can run on machines holding the data.

Object stores = storage and compute usually separated.

Locality advantage is lost if using erasure coding (since data must be combined from multiple machines).

HDFS Architecture

Based on shared-nothing (each machine has its own disks, no special hardware).

Contrasts with shared-disk storage (NAS, SAN) → centralized storage appliances using custom hardware.

In HDFS:

Each machine runs a daemon to expose its disks.

A NameNode tracks which file blocks live on which machines.

Together they form one big distributed filesystem.

Fault Tolerance

To handle machine/disk failures:

Replication: multiple copies of data blocks across machines.

Or erasure coding (e.g., Reed–Solomon codes) for lower storage overhead.

Similar to RAID, but at datacenter scale (over the network, not just local disks).

Scalability

HDFS can scale to tens of thousands of machines.

Storage capacity = hundreds of petabytes.

Why feasible:

Commodity hardware

Open-source software

Much cheaper than specialized storage appliances.




MapReduce Job Execution

MapReduce is a programming framework for processing large datasets in a distributed filesystem such as HDFS. Its execution pattern is similar to Unix pipelines but designed for parallel, distributed computation.

Steps in a MapReduce Job

The execution resembles the log analysis example:

Read input files and break into records

Each record is usually one line.

In the log example, \n is the record separator.

Mapper function

Processes each record to extract a key-value pair.

Example: awk '{print $7}' extracts URL as the key, leaves value empty.

Sort by key

All key-value pairs are sorted based on the key.

In the log example, done with the sort command.

Reducer function

Iterates over sorted key-value pairs.

Because sorting makes same keys adjacent, it’s easy to group and combine them.

Example: uniq -c counts number of adjacent records with the same key.

👉 These four steps = one MapReduce job.

Step 1: Input format parser handles splitting into records.

Step 2: Mapper (custom logic).

Step 3: Sort step (done automatically by MapReduce).

Step 4: Reducer (custom logic).

Mapper

Called once per input record.

Job: extract key-value pairs from the record.

For each input, it may produce:

Zero pairs

One pair

Many pairs

Does not keep state across records — each record is processed independently.

Reducer

Collects all values for the same key.

Called with an iterator over those values.

Can generate any number of output records.

Example: count number of times each URL appeared.

👉 If another sorting stage is needed (like ranking URLs by popularity), a second MapReduce job is required.

Mapper → prepares data for sorting.

Reducer → processes sorted data.

Distributed Execution of MapReduce

The main difference from Unix pipelines:

Automatic parallelization across machines.

Developer only writes mapper and reducer functions.

The framework handles:

Data movement

Distribution of computation

Machine scheduling

Implementation

Possible to use Unix tools as mappers/reducers.

More common: implement in a programming language.

Hadoop MapReduce:

Mapper = Java class implementing a specific interface.

Reducer = Java class too.

MongoDB and CouchDB:

Mappers and reducers are written in JavaScript.

Partitioning Input

Input = typically a directory in HDFS.

Each file or block in the directory = a partition → processed by one map task.

Example: m₁, m₂, m₃ (three parallel map tasks).

Data Locality

Input files = large (hundreds of MB each).

Scheduler tries to run a map task on a machine that already stores a replica of the input file.

Known as putting computation near the data.

Benefit: reduces network copying, saves bandwidth, and improves speed.

Deploying Application Code

Usually, the mapper/reducer code is not preinstalled on worker machines.

Framework copies code (e.g., JAR files) to the machines before starting tasks.

Then begins:

Reading the input file.

Passing records one by one to the mapper.

Mapper outputs key-value pairs.

Partitioning Output for Reducers

Reduce side is also partitioned.

Number of reduce tasks = chosen by the job author (not tied to number of map tasks).

To ensure all records for the same key go to the same reducer:

Framework uses a hash of the key → determines reducer assignment.

Sorting (Shuffle Phase)

All key-value pairs must be sorted.

Too large for one machine → sorting is done in stages.

Each mapper partitions its output by reducer (based on key hash).

Each partition is written to a sorted file on mapper’s local disk (using an approach like SSTables/LSM-trees).

When a mapper finishes:

Scheduler notifies reducers.

Reducers fetch sorted partitions from mappers.

👉 This process = the shuffle.

Misleading term — unlike shuffling cards, there is no randomness here.

Reduce Phase

Reducer merges sorted files from mappers, preserving order.

Records with the same key become adjacent.

Reducer:

Receives key + iterator over values.

Processes records (may not fit in memory, so processed incrementally).

Writes output records to HDFS files (local + replicas).

MapReduce Workflows

A single MapReduce job is often not enough.

Example:

Job 1: count page views per URL.

Job 2: sort to find most popular URLs.

Chaining Jobs

Output of one job = input of another.

Hadoop does not have built-in workflow support.

Achieved by:

Writing output to an HDFS directory.

Configuring the next job to read from that directory.

From framework’s perspective → independent jobs.

👉 This is like writing intermediate results to temporary files, not like Unix pipelines that pass data directly via memory buffers.

Job Dependencies

A job’s output is only valid if it completes successfully.

Next job can only start when previous jobs finish successfully.

Workflow Schedulers

To manage dependencies, tools exist:

Oozie

Azkaban

Luigi

Airflow

Pinball

They also help with managing large collections of jobs.

Workflows of 50–100 jobs are common (e.g., recommendation systems).

In large orgs, many teams may run jobs that depend on each other’s output.

Higher-Level Tools

To simplify multi-stage MapReduce workflows, higher-level frameworks exist:

Pig

Hive

Cascading

Crunch

FlumeJava

These tools:

Automatically generate MapReduce workflows.

Hide low-level details of chaining jobs.






Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping
The Need for Joins in Batch Processing

Many datasets contain associations between records:

Foreign keys in relational databases

Document references in document databases

Edges in graph models

A join is needed when code must access records on both sides of such associations.

Denormalization can sometimes reduce the need for joins, but not eliminate it entirely.

Indexes vs. Full Scans

Databases: For small queries, use indexes → quick lookups, sometimes multiple index lookups for joins.

MapReduce: Has no indexes.

Always performs a full scan of input files (like a full table scan).

For small lookups → very expensive.

For analytic queries → full scans make sense because:

We usually want aggregates over many records.

Scanning is acceptable if parallelized across many machines.

Joins in Batch Processing

In batch jobs, joins mean resolving all associations across the entire dataset (not just one user’s lookup).

Example: Instead of looking up data for one user, we process all users’ data together.

Example: Analysis of User Activity Events

Scenario:

Left: Log of user activity events (clickstream).

Right: Database of users (user profiles).

Together → star schema:

Events = fact table

Users = dimension table

Need: Correlate user activity with user profiles.

Example: Find most popular pages for each age group.

Problem: Activity log only has user_id, not full profile.

Solution: Join activity log with user database.

Naïve Approach: Query Database for Each Record

Process events one by one and query user DB by user_id.

Problems:

Very poor performance → limited by database round-trip time.

Cache effectiveness depends on data distribution.

Parallel queries could overwhelm the database.

Batch job becomes nondeterministic since remote DB may change.

Better Approach: Co-locating Data

Extract a copy of the user database (via ETL or backup).

Store it in HDFS, alongside activity log.

Then use MapReduce to join both datasets locally.

This avoids network lookups and ensures deterministic processing.

Sort-Merge Joins

Mapper extracts key and value from input records.

From activity log → key = user_id, value = activity event.

From user DB → key = user_id, value = profile info (e.g., DOB).

Framework partitions and sorts by key → ensures:

All records with the same key go to the same reducer.

Records can even be secondarily sorted → user record first, events ordered by timestamp.

Reducer logic:

Receives user_id and all associated values.

Stores DOB, then processes activity events → outputs (url, viewer_age).

Later jobs can aggregate page views by age group.

Why efficient?

Only one user profile in memory at a time.

No network requests.

High throughput.

Bringing Related Data Together

Sort-merge join ensures all related data is brought to one reducer call.

Reducer logic remains simple and efficient.

Conceptually:

Mapper output = like “sending messages” to reducers.

Key = destination address.

All values for same key → same reducer.

Advantage:

Application code only processes local data.

MapReduce handles failures and retries automatically.

GROUP BY in MapReduce

Another use of “bringing related data together” is grouping by key.

Equivalent to SQL GROUP BY.

Typical operations after grouping:

COUNT(*) → number of records per group.

SUM(field) → aggregate values.

Top-k records by ranking function.

How it works:

Mappers emit key-value pairs using grouping key.

Partitioning + sorting ensures same key → same reducer.

Thus, grouping looks very similar to joins.

Example: Sessionization

Use case: Collating activity events by user session.

Purpose: Find sequence of user actions.

Applications:

A/B testing (compare old vs. new UI versions).

Marketing effectiveness analysis.

Problem: With multiple web servers, logs are scattered.

Solution: Use session cookie or user ID as key → bring all events for a user/session to one reducer.

Handling Skew

Problem: Some keys (e.g., celebrities in social networks) are hot keys / linchpin objects with millions of records.

Causes skew (hot spots):

One reducer gets far more work.

Slows down entire job → MapReduce waits for slowest reducer.

Techniques for Handling Skew

Pig’s Skewed Join Method

First: Run sampling to find hot keys.

Then:

Records for hot key → distributed across multiple reducers (randomly).

Other join input (user DB) → replicate relevant records to all reducers.

Crunch’s Sharded Join Method

Similar idea.

Requires explicit declaration of hot keys.

Hive’s Skewed Join Optimization

Hot keys declared in table metadata.

Records for hot keys stored separately.

Uses map-side join for hot keys.

Two-Stage Grouping for Aggregation

Stage 1: Randomly distribute records → each reducer partially aggregates hot key’s data.

Stage 2: Combine partial results into final aggregated value.





Map-Side Joins
Reduce-Side Joins Recap

In reduce-side joins:

Mappers prepare input (extract key-value pairs, partition, sort).

Reducers perform the actual join logic.

Advantage: Works with any kind of input dataset (no assumptions).

Disadvantage: Sorting, copying data across the network, and merging are expensive.

Data may be written to disk multiple times due to limited memory buffers.

Map-Side Join Basics

If we can make assumptions about the input data, joins can be faster using a map-side join.

Characteristics of map-side join:

No reducers.

No sorting.

Each mapper:

Reads one input file block.

Writes one output file.

Much simpler and more efficient.

Broadcast Hash Joins

Used when:

Large dataset is joined with a small dataset.

Small dataset fits in memory.

Process:

Mapper loads small dataset (e.g., user DB) into an in-memory hash table.

Then scans the large dataset (e.g., activity events).

For each record → does a hash lookup.

Parallelism:

Each mapper processes one block of the large dataset.

Each mapper loads the full small dataset into memory.

Hence “broadcast”: small dataset is replicated across all mappers.

Supported by:

Pig (replicated join)

Hive (MapJoin)

Cascading

Crunch

Data warehouse query engines (e.g., Impala).

Alternative: Store the small dataset as a read-only index on local disk.

Frequently used parts stay cached in memory (OS page cache).

Allows fast lookups even if dataset doesn’t fully fit in memory.

Partitioned Hash Joins

Assumption: Both datasets are partitioned in the same way.

Example: Partition both activity logs and user DB by the last digit of user_id.

Mapper 3 loads users with IDs ending in 3 into a hash table.

Then processes events with IDs ending in 3.

Benefits:

Each mapper only needs to load a smaller partition of data.

Reduces memory requirements.

Condition:

Both datasets must:

Have the same number of partitions.

Use the same key and same hash function.

Common when inputs are produced by prior MapReduce jobs.

In Hive → called bucketed map joins.

Map-Side Merge Joins

Applies when datasets are:

Partitioned in the same way.

Sorted by the same key.

Process:

Mapper scans both datasets in order.

Performs a merge join (like reducer would normally do).

Does not require loading into memory.

Often, prior MapReduce jobs already produced sorted/partitioned data.

Can be done in a separate map-only job if:

Sorted datasets are needed for other purposes.

Or if separating jobs makes workflow cleaner.

MapReduce Workflows with Map-Side Joins

Choice of map-side vs. reduce-side join affects the structure of output:

Reduce-side join output → partitioned & sorted by join key.

Map-side join output → partitioned & sorted the same way as the large input.

Map-side joins require stronger assumptions:

Input size, partitioning, sorting.

Must know physical layout of datasets (not just format and directory).

Metadata required:

Partitioning scheme.

Number of partitions.

Partitioning and sorting keys.

In Hadoop → metadata often managed by HCatalog and Hive Metastore.

The Output of Batch Workflows
Why Run Batch Jobs?

Question: What do we get from these workflows?

Recall database query purposes:

OLTP (transactional): Small lookups, via indexes, shown to users (e.g., webpages).

Analytics: Large scans, groupings, aggregations → outputs like reports (graphs, rankings, breakdowns).

Batch processing:

Not OLTP.

Closer to analytics, but different.

Output is often not a report, but a new data structure used elsewhere.

Building Search Indexes

Google’s original use of MapReduce → build search engine indexes.

Workflow: 5–10 MapReduce jobs.

Even today, Hadoop MapReduce is good for building Lucene/Solr indexes.

Search index:

A file (term dictionary).

Lets you look up a word → list of document IDs (postings list).

Real implementations add ranking, synonyms, spell correction, etc.

Batch building process:

Mappers partition documents.

Reducers build indexes for partitions.

Index files written to HDFS.

Index files:

Immutable (read-only).

If data changes →

Option 1: Re-run workflow for whole dataset (simple, expensive).

Option 2: Incremental updates (new Lucene segments, background merges).

Key-Value Stores as Batch Process Output

Other common use: Build ML systems and recommendation systems.

Example outputs:

Classifiers (spam filters, anomaly detection, image recognition).

Recommendations (friends, products, related searches).

These outputs are stored in databases (queried by web apps).

Why Not Write Directly to Database in Mappers/Reducers?

Problems:

Slow: A network request per record is far slower than batch throughput.

Even batching doesn’t solve performance.

Overload: Many parallel tasks writing to DB → overwhelms it.

Hurts performance of live queries.

Loss of atomicity:

Normally, MapReduce jobs guarantee all-or-nothing output.

Writing to external DB → creates partial, inconsistent side effects.

Better Solution: Build Immutable Database Files

Instead of writing directly to DB:

Batch job builds a brand-new database as files in HDFS.

Files are immutable once written.

Later, they are bulk-loaded into production servers.

Supported by:

Voldemort

Terrapin

ElephantDB

HBase (bulk loading).

Advantages:

Efficient (MapReduce already extracts keys and sorts them).

Simple data structures → no need for WAL.

Servers can continue serving old files while new ones load.

Switching between versions is atomic and safe.




Philosophy of Batch Process Outputs

The Unix philosophy emphasizes simple, predictable programs: each program takes input, processes it, and produces output without altering the original input or causing unintended side effects.

Batch jobs like MapReduce follow this same idea, which brings several benefits:

Bug recovery and fault tolerance

If the job produces incorrect or corrupted results because of buggy code, you can just rerun it with fixed code.

You can also keep the old outputs in separate directories and switch between them as needed.

By contrast, databases with read-write transactions can be corrupted by bad code, and rolling back the code won’t fix the already-bad data.

This approach is sometimes called human fault tolerance, since it helps recover from developer mistakes.

Faster feature development

Because mistakes are reversible, developers can experiment more freely.

This matches Agile principles of minimizing irreversibility.

Automatic retries for failures

If a map or reduce task fails, MapReduce reruns it automatically on the same input.

If it’s a transient failure (like a hardware glitch), it works fine.

If it’s a code bug, it will keep failing, and the job eventually fails.

This retry safety is possible because inputs are immutable and failed outputs are discarded.

Reusability of inputs

The same input files can be used for many jobs, including monitoring jobs that check output quality (e.g., comparing new results with previous runs).

Separation of logic and wiring

Like Unix tools, MapReduce jobs keep the logic (what the program does) separate from the wiring (input/output locations).

This separation allows code reuse: one team writes the job, other teams decide where/when to run it.

Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases

Hadoop can be seen as a distributed version of Unix:

HDFS acts like the filesystem.

MapReduce is like a quirky process, with a built-in sort step between map and reduce.

Historically, many parallel algorithms (joins, groupings, etc.) were already present in Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) databases like Teradata and Tandem NonStop SQL.

Key Difference:

MPP databases are optimized for running parallel SQL queries.

Hadoop + HDFS is more general-purpose: it can run any kind of program, not just SQL queries.

Diversity of Storage

Databases require data to follow a strict model (relational, document, etc.).

Distributed filesystems like HDFS treat files as raw byte sequences, so they can store:

Text, images, videos

Sensor readings, sparse matrices, genome sequences

Feature vectors, or anything else

Hadoop’s big advantage: you can dump raw data into HDFS first, and decide how to process it later.

This contrasts with MPP databases, which need careful upfront schema design and import into a proprietary format.

Practical benefit: making data quickly available is often more valuable than having it perfectly modeled from the start.

Similar to a data warehouse, Hadoop lets you centralize data from across an organization.

But unlike data warehouses, Hadoop doesn’t force strict schema design upfront → this is known as a data lake.

Schema-on-read approach:

Data producers dump raw data.

Data consumers decide later how to interpret it.

Different teams can create different views of the same raw data.

This flexibility is called the sushi principle: “raw data is better.”

ETL use case:

Raw data from transactional systems is dumped into HDFS.

MapReduce jobs clean and transform it.

Data is later loaded into an MPP warehouse for analysis.

This decouples data collection (fast and raw) from data modeling (done later).

Diversity of Processing Models

MPP databases are monolithic systems:

They integrate storage layout, query planning, scheduling, and execution.

This integration allows highly optimized performance for SQL queries.

SQL also provides expressive queries, easy semantics, and compatibility with BI tools (like Tableau).

But SQL isn’t enough:

Some workloads can’t be expressed in SQL, such as:

Machine learning and recommendation systems

Full-text search with ranking

Image analysis

Application-specific data processing (e.g., fraud detection models)

These require writing custom code, not just queries.

MapReduce’s contribution:

Allowed engineers to run arbitrary code at scale.

SQL engines like Hive were built on top of MapReduce.

But engineers could also write non-SQL batch jobs.

Evolution beyond MapReduce:

MapReduce proved limiting and inefficient for some workloads.

New processing models (beyond SQL + MapReduce) were developed.

Hadoop’s openness made it possible to add these models—unlike monolithic MPP systems.

Shared cluster advantage:

All these processing models can run on the same Hadoop cluster, using the same HDFS data.

This avoids moving data between different specialized systems.

It makes it easier to experiment and derive value from data.

Hadoop ecosystem diversity:

HBase → random-access OLTP database

Impala → MPP-style analytic database

Neither uses MapReduce, but both use HDFS.

They serve different workloads but coexist on the same system.




Designing for Frequent Faults

When comparing MapReduce and MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) databases, two big differences stand out:

Handling of faults (failures)

Use of memory and disk

Fault Tolerance in MPP Databases

Failure handling:

If a node crashes during query execution, most MPP databases abort the entire query.

The query must either be manually resubmitted or automatically restarted.

Why acceptable?

Queries are short (a few seconds or minutes).

Retrying is cheap, so restarting the whole query is fine.

Memory usage:

MPP databases try to keep as much data in memory (e.g., hash joins) to avoid expensive disk reads.

Fault Tolerance in MapReduce

Task-level recovery:

A failure in a single map or reduce task doesn’t fail the entire job.

Failed tasks are retried individually.

Disk-based design:

Very eager to write data to disk for two reasons:

Fault tolerance (restart from disk if a task fails).

Dataset size assumption (data may not fit in memory).

Why better for large jobs?

Jobs running for hours on massive data are likely to encounter task failures.

Restarting the whole job would be too costly.

Task-level recovery is slower for fault-free jobs but better when failures are frequent.

Are These Assumptions Realistic?

Hardware failures:

Clusters do have machine failures, but they are not very frequent.

Most jobs probably won’t face a hardware failure.

So why design for frequent failures?

The answer lies in the environment MapReduce was designed for (Google’s datacenters).

Google’s Environment and Preemption

Shared datacenters:

Both online production services and offline batch jobs run on the same machines.

Tasks run inside containers with resource allocations (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.).

Priorities and preemption:

Each task has a priority.

If a higher-priority task needs resources, lower-priority ones can be terminated (preempted).

Pricing:

Teams pay for the resources they use.

Higher priority = higher cost.

Resource overcommitment:

Machines are overcommitted since resources can be reclaimed anytime.

Low-priority MapReduce jobs run on “spare” resources.

Impact of Preemption on MapReduce Jobs

Preemption frequency:

A MapReduce task running for 1 hour has ~5% chance of termination (due to preemption).

This is 10× more frequent than failures caused by hardware or reboots.

Probability with many tasks:

A job with 100 tasks × 10 minutes each has >50% chance that at least one will be terminated.

Key takeaway:

MapReduce’s design (task-level recovery, disk writes) is mainly to handle frequent preemptions, not just hardware failures.

Preemption in Open-Source Schedulers

Unlike Google, open-source systems rarely use preemption:

YARN: supports preemption for balancing queues, but not full priority preemption.

Mesos and Kubernetes: do not support general priority preemption (as of writing).

Result:

In such environments, MapReduce’s design choices (disk-heavy, fault-tolerant) may be less beneficial.

Beyond MapReduce

MapReduce popularity:

Very popular in the late 2000s.

But it’s only one model for distributed systems.

When it’s useful:

Good learning tool (clear abstraction over a distributed filesystem).

Not easy to use directly (complex jobs need a lot of code, e.g., implementing joins from scratch).

Higher-level abstractions:

Tools like Pig, Hive, Cascading, Crunch were built on top of MapReduce.

They simplify coding but don’t fix MapReduce’s execution model limitations.

Performance trade-off:

MapReduce = robust but slow.

Other tools = much faster for some tasks.

Materialization of Intermediate State

Job independence:

Every MapReduce job is independent.

Output of one job must be stored in a directory → used as input for the next.

External workflow schedulers manage dependencies.

When reasonable:

If output is published widely and reused across jobs/teams.

When wasteful:

If output is only consumed by one other job (same team).

Then it’s just intermediate state.

Complex workflows (50–100 jobs, e.g., recommendation systems) create a lot of such intermediate data.

Materialization downside (compared to Unix pipes):

Next job waits until all previous tasks finish (stragglers delay pipeline).

Redundant mappers: often just re-read reducer output.

Files stored in distributed filesystem are replicated unnecessarily (too heavy for temporary data).

Dataflow Engines

Developed to fix MapReduce’s inefficiencies.

Popular ones: Spark, Tez, Flink.

Handle the entire workflow as one job (not separate jobs).

Key Features of Dataflow Engines

Generalization of operators:

Not just strict map → reduce stages.

Operators can be connected flexibly.

Ways to connect operators:

Repartition + sort (like shuffle in MapReduce, used for joins/grouping).

Partition without sorting (efficient for hash joins).

Broadcast joins (send small dataset to all partitions).

Advantages over MapReduce

Sorting is only done when necessary (not by default).

No redundant map tasks.

Scheduler has full view of workflow → can optimize data locality.

Intermediate state can stay in memory or local disk, avoiding heavy HDFS replication.

Operators can start as soon as input is ready (pipeline execution).

JVM reuse reduces startup overhead (MapReduce launches new JVM for every task).

Compatibility

Workflows in Pig, Hive, Cascading can switch from MapReduce to Spark/Tez with just a config change.

Tez: lightweight, relies on YARN shuffle service.

Spark & Flink: larger frameworks with full APIs, schedulers, and communication layers.




Fault Tolerance
Materialization in MapReduce

In MapReduce, intermediate state is fully materialized (saved) to a distributed filesystem like HDFS.

Advantage: this makes the data durable, so if a task fails, it can be restarted on another machine and simply re-read the same input from HDFS.

This provides easy fault tolerance.

Spark, Flink, and Tez

These engines avoid writing intermediate state to HDFS (to improve performance).

If a machine fails and the intermediate data is lost, it is recomputed from:

earlier intermediary stages, or

the original input data (normally on HDFS).

Tracking Data Ancestry

To support recomputation, the framework must track how each piece of data was computed:

which input partitions were used,

which operators were applied.

Spark: uses the RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) abstraction to track data lineage.

Flink: uses checkpoints of operator state so an operator can resume after a fault.

Determinism in Computation

During recomputation, it is important to know if the computation is deterministic:

Deterministic: same input → always same output.

Non-deterministic: same input → could produce different outputs.

If lost data was already sent downstream, inconsistent recomputation creates contradictions.

Solution: restart downstream operators as well.

To avoid this cascading failure, operators should be deterministic.

Risks of nondeterminism:

hash table iteration order,

use of random numbers,

use of system clock,

dependence on external data sources.

Fix: use fixed seeds for randomness and avoid nondeterministic operations.

When Materialization is Better

Recomputing is not always efficient.

If intermediate data is much smaller than input, or computation is CPU-intensive, it is cheaper to materialize intermediate results rather than recompute.

Discussion of Materialization

Unix Analogy:

MapReduce = writing intermediate results to temporary files.

Dataflow engines (Spark, Flink, Tez) = like Unix pipes (data streams directly between operators).

Flink is built for pipelined execution: operators process data incrementally without waiting for the full input.

Sorting requires collecting the entire input first (since the smallest key could appear last). Some operators must accumulate state.

At the end of the job, the final output is materialized (written back to HDFS).

Inputs = immutable,

Output = completely replaced (like MapReduce).

Advantage: intermediate states don’t need to be written to HDFS, improving performance.

Graphs and Iterative Processing
Graph Use in Batch Processing

Graphs are useful for offline analysis, e.g. machine learning (recommendation engines, ranking).

Famous example: PageRank estimates web page popularity.

Dataflow Engines vs Graph Processing

Spark, Flink, Tez use DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for dataflow.

But this DAG represents operator flow, not graph data.

In graph processing, the data itself is a graph (vertices + edges).

Iterative Graph Algorithms

Many graph algorithms are iterative:

propagate info edge by edge,

repeat until convergence or no edges left.

Example: transitive closure (repeatedly following "location within location" edges).

Storing graphs on HDFS is possible, but MapReduce is inefficient because it always:

reads the entire dataset,

produces a whole new dataset each iteration,

even if only a small part changed.

The Pregel Processing Model
Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)

Pregel (by Google) popularized this model.

Implementations: Apache Giraph, Spark GraphX, Flink Gelly.

Messaging Between Vertices

In Pregel:

one vertex can send messages to another, usually along edges.

each iteration: a function runs on each vertex with all incoming messages.

vertices remember their state in memory across iterations.

If no messages arrive → no work needed.

Similar to actor model:

each vertex ≈ actor,

difference: Pregel ensures fault tolerance and message timing (synchronous rounds).

Fault Tolerance in Pregel

Vertices communicate only via messages, making batching possible.

Synchronization happens only between iterations.

Guarantee: messages delivered exactly once in next iteration.

Fault tolerance:

state of all vertices is checkpointed at the end of each iteration,

if a node fails → roll back to last checkpoint and restart.

If deterministic + messages logged → can selectively recover only lost partitions.

Parallel Execution

A vertex doesn’t know its machine placement; it sends messages by vertex ID.

The framework partitions the graph across machines.

Ideally: colocate frequently communicating vertices.

Reality: partitioning often arbitrary → lots of cross-machine communication.

Problem: intermediate messages may be bigger than the original graph, slowing execution.

If graph fits in memory on one machine → single-machine algorithm often faster.

Even if graph exceeds memory but fits on disk → frameworks like GraphChi can be efficient.

Only when graph is too big for one machine → distributed Pregel-style system is needed.

High-Level APIs and Languages

After MapReduce, execution engines became mature and scalable (10,000+ machines, petabytes of data).

Focus shifted to:

better programming models,

more efficient processing,

solving more complex problems.

High-Level Languages

Hive, Pig, Cascading, Crunch made programming easier than raw MapReduce.

With Tez, they could move to new engines without rewriting jobs.

Spark and Flink also provide their own high-level dataflow APIs (inspired by FlumeJava).

Relational-Style Abstractions

Dataflow APIs use relational-style building blocks:

joins,

grouping by key,

filtering,

aggregations (sum, count, etc.).

Internally: executed using efficient join and grouping algorithms.

Benefits

Less code → easier programming.

Support for interactive use (writing queries incrementally in a shell).

Helpful for data exploration.

Reminiscent of the Unix philosophy (chaining small operations).

Improves both:

human productivity,

machine-level execution efficiency.




The Move Toward Declarative Query Languages
Joins as Relational Operators

Specifying joins declaratively (as relational operators) allows the framework to analyze join properties and automatically choose the best join algorithm.

Systems like Hive, Spark, and Flink use cost-based query optimizers to:

Select the most suitable join algorithm.

Change the order of joins to minimize intermediate state.

Advantage: Users don’t need to understand all join algorithms in detail—the query optimizer makes those decisions.

Declarative Joins vs. MapReduce Model

In SQL, joins are declarative: you specify what joins you want.

In MapReduce, the model is based on function callbacks:

Each record or group of records is passed to a user-defined function (mapper/reducer).

The function can run arbitrary code (e.g., parsing, NLP, image analysis, statistical algorithms).

This makes MapReduce-like systems more flexible than MPP databases, since:

Databases support user-defined functions (UDFs), but they’re harder to use.

They’re often not well integrated with common dependency management tools (Maven, npm, Rubygems).

Declarative Features Beyond Joins

Problem with callbacks: Calling a function per record adds CPU overhead.

Solution: Express simple operations declaratively (e.g., filtering or field selection).

Benefits:

Optimizers can exploit column-oriented storage → only read required columns.

Frameworks can use vectorized execution:

Tight inner loops.

CPU-cache friendly.

Avoiding repeated function calls.

Examples:

Hive, Spark DataFrames, Impala use vectorized execution.

Spark generates JVM bytecode.

Impala uses LLVM to generate native machine code.

Resulting Advantage

With declarative APIs + query optimizers:

Batch processing frameworks achieve performance comparable to MPP databases.

But still retain flexibility → can run arbitrary code and read arbitrary data formats.

Specialization for Different Domains
Need for Reusable Implementations

Running arbitrary code is flexible, but many common patterns repeat → reusable blocks are useful.

Historically:

MPP databases mainly served business intelligence & reporting.

Expanding domains:

Machine learning → needs statistical and numerical algorithms.

Mahout (on MapReduce, Spark, Flink).

MADlib (inside relational MPP DB Apache HAWQ).

Spatial algorithms → e.g., k-nearest neighbors (similarity search in multi-dimensional space).

Genome analysis → approximate string search (find similar but not identical sequences).

Trend

Batch processing engines are now used in many domains.

Convergence:

Batch systems gain declarative operators + built-in functions.

MPP databases become more programmable + flexible.

Both are essentially data storage and processing systems.

Summary
Roots in Unix Philosophy

Inspired by Unix tools like awk, grep, sort.

Key design principles:

Immutable inputs.

Outputs as inputs to future programs.

Complex tasks solved by composing small tools.

In Unix → composition via files & pipes.

In MapReduce → composition via distributed filesystem (e.g., HDFS).

Dataflow engines optimize further → avoid unnecessary materialization, but still use HDFS for initial input and final output.

Two Main Problems in Distributed Batch Processing
1. Partitioning

In MapReduce:

Mappers partitioned by input file blocks.

Output is repartitioned, sorted, merged into reducer partitions.

Purpose: group all related data (same key) together.

Post-MapReduce engines:

Try to avoid sorting unless necessary.

Otherwise use a similar partitioning approach.

2. Fault Tolerance

MapReduce:

Writes intermediate results to disk.

Pros: Easy recovery (re-run only failed task).

Cons: Slower execution in failure-free cases.

Dataflow engines:

Keep more state in memory.

Less materialization → faster in normal case.

On failure → must recompute more data.

Use deterministic operators to reduce recomputation.

Join Algorithms in Batch Processing

Sort-Merge Joins

Extract join key → partition, sort, merge.

All records with same key go to same reducer → reducer outputs joined records.

Broadcast Hash Joins

One input is small → load into hash table.

Each mapper:

Loads hash table of small input.

Scans large input, probes hash table.

Partitioned Hash Joins

Both inputs partitioned using same key + hash function.

Each partition independently builds & probes hash tables.

Restricted Programming Model

Batch jobs use stateless callback functions (mappers/reducers).

No side effects except writing designated output.

Advantage:

Framework can retry tasks safely.

Failed outputs discarded.

Even if multiple tasks succeed, only one output is kept.

Reliable Semantics

Developer does not need to implement fault tolerance.

Framework guarantees:

Final output = same as if no failures occurred.

Stronger guarantees than online services (where failures may cause inconsistencies).

Defining Batch Processing

A batch job:

Reads input data.

Produces output data.

Does not modify input (output is derived).

Input data is bounded (fixed size, e.g., log files, DB snapshot).

Because input is bounded:

Job knows when input ends.

Job eventually completes.

Transition to Next Chapter

In stream processing:

Input is unbounded (continuous, never-ending).

Jobs never complete (always more data to process).

While stream and batch processing share concepts, unbounded input introduces key differences in system design.
