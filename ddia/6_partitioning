Perfect â€” youâ€™re now entering Chapter 6 of Designing Data-Intensive Applications, which shifts from replication (multiple copies of the same data) to partitioning (splitting data into pieces). Letâ€™s go step by step.

ðŸ”¹ Replication vs. Partitioning

Replication = store the same data on multiple nodes (for fault tolerance & high availability).

Partitioning (a.k.a. Sharding) = split the dataset into different subsets, each stored on a different node (for scalability).

Replication = copies of the same book ðŸ“š.
Partitioning = splitting one huge book into chapters across shelves ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“–.

ðŸ”¹ Terminology

Different systems use different words for the same idea:

Shard â†’ MongoDB, Elasticsearch, SolrCloud

Region â†’ HBase

Tablet â†’ Bigtable

VNode â†’ Cassandra, Riak

vBucket â†’ Couchbase

But the general academic / established word is partition â†’ thatâ€™s what the book uses.

ðŸ”¹ How Partitioning Works

Each record (row/document) belongs to exactly one partition.

Each partition acts like a mini-database that stores only part of the data.

The database system decides which partition a record goes to (based on hashing, ranges, etc.â€”explained later in the chapter).

ðŸ”¹ Why Partition?

The main reason: Scalability ðŸš€

Storage scaling â†’
A single machine cannot hold petabytes of data, so data must be split across many disks/machines.

Throughput scaling â†’

Queries that hit only one partition can be handled independently by the node storing that partition.

More nodes = more parallel query capacity.

For analytics or large queries, operations can sometimes be parallelized across many partitions (though itâ€™s more complex).

So: partitioning helps with both big datasets and high query loads.

ðŸ”¹ Shared-nothing architecture

Partitioning relies on a shared-nothing cluster:

Each node is independent (its own CPU, RAM, disk).

Nodes donâ€™t share memory or disk directly.

Communication happens only via the network.

This design avoids bottlenecks and scales better.

ðŸ”¹ History

1980s: Partitioned DBs first appeared (Teradata, Tandem NonStop SQL).

2000s+: Re-discovered by NoSQL systems (MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase) and Hadoop data warehouses.

Partitioning is not newâ€”itâ€™s just been reinvented to handle todayâ€™s web-scale workloads.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Next in the Chapter

This section is just an intro to partitioning. The chapter will dive into:

Partitioning strategies (by key range, by hash, etc.).

Rebalancing (when adding/removing nodes, how to move data without downtime).

Routing queries (how the system knows which partition has the data).

âœ… In short:
Replication keeps multiple copies of the same data for safety. Partitioning splits data into pieces to fit massive datasets and handle high query load. Each partition is a mini-database, spread across a shared-nothing cluster, allowing horizontal scaling.


Partitioning, as discussed in this chapter, is a way of intentionally breaking a large database down into
smaller ones. It has nothing to do with network partitions (netsplits), a type of fault in the network between
nodes. We will discuss such faults in Chapter 8.
