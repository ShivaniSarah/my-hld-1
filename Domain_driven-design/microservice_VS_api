The terms Microservice and API are related but refer to different concepts in software architecture. Here's a clear comparison:



| Term                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microservice**                            | An independent, deployable service that performs a specific business function as part of a larger system. It's an **architectural style**.                      |
| **API (Application Programming Interface)** | A **contract/interface** that defines how different software components or services communicate. An API is how you **talk to** a microservice (or any service). |



| Aspect         | Microservice                                            | API                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Type           | Architectural unit                                      | Interface (method of communication)                   |
| Scope          | Contains business logic, data access, and often an API  | Just defines operations/methods (like REST endpoints) |
| Responsibility | Implements and exposes APIs                             | Describes how to consume functionality                |
| Deployment     | Independently deployable unit (e.g., a container or VM) | Not deployed separately; part of a service            |
| Example        | `OrderService` handling orders                          | `GET /orders/{id}` endpoint                           |




üí¨ Analogy
Microservice = Restaurant

API = Menu

The restaurant (microservice) prepares food (business logic), and the menu (API) shows what you can order (available operations).


| Feature                                 | Microservice | API |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | --- |
| Has independent runtime                 | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå   |
| Has its own database                    | ‚úÖ (often)    | ‚ùå   |
| Defines contract for communication      | ‚úÖ (via API)  | ‚úÖ   |
| Used to implement a business capability | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå   |
| Can be reused across services           | ‚úÖ            | ‚úÖ   |



‚ûï In Practice
In a microservices architecture, each microservice exposes APIs for other services or clients to consume.

If you're designing a system:

Microservices define how the system is structured.

APIs define how parts of the system communicate.



üîó What are REST Endpoints?
REST endpoints are specific URLs that represent resources in a RESTful web service. Each endpoint corresponds to a particular operation (CRUD) on a resource using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

üß± Components of a REST Endpoint
A typical REST endpoint looks like:


HTTP_METHOD /resource/{id}



HTTP_METHOD: Action type (GET, POST, etc.)

/resource: Collection name (e.g., /users)

{id}: Optional path parameter for a specific resource




üìã Common REST Endpoints (CRUD Example for User)

| Action         | HTTP Method | Endpoint      | Description              |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Create User    | `POST`      | `/users`      | Create a new user        |
| Get All Users  | `GET`       | `/users`      | Retrieve a list of users |
| Get User by ID | `GET`       | `/users/{id}` | Retrieve a specific user |
| Update User    | `PUT`       | `/users/{id}` | Update an existing user  |
| Delete User    | `DELETE`    | `/users/{id}` | Delete a user            |



üõ†Ô∏è Example in Spring Boot (Java)

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() { ... }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) { ... }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) { ... }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
}


‚úÖ REST Endpoint Best Practices
Use nouns, not verbs (e.g., /orders, not /getOrders)

Use plural names for collections (e.g., /products)

Use HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 201 Created)

Keep URLs predictable and hierarchical

Use query parameters for filtering/sorting (GET /users?age=25)
