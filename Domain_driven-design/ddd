Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software design that focuses on deeply understanding the business domain and building the software around the core domain logic — not around technical concerns.

🧠 Core Idea of DDD
"Focus on the business domain. Let the domain model drive the design and architecture of your system."

🧩 Key Concepts of DDD
1. Domain
The subject area your application addresses (e.g., e-commerce, banking, logistics).

It’s the real-world system you are modeling in software.

2. Model
An abstraction of the domain — expressed in code (usually through classes and methods).

The model captures the business rules, behaviors, and terminology.

🏛️ Building Blocks
🔷 Entity
An object that has a unique identity (usually by ID) and lifecycle.

Example: Order, Customer, Invoice.

java
Copy
Edit
public class Customer {
    private UUID id;
    private String name;
    // identity is maintained regardless of attribute changes
}
🔶 Value Object
An immutable object without an identity.

Used to represent attributes or descriptions.

java
Copy
Edit
public class Address {
    private final String street;
    private final String city;
    // no ID, equality is by value
}
🔷 Aggregate
A cluster of related entities and value objects that is treated as a single unit for data changes.

One entity is the Aggregate Root — all access is through it.

java
Copy
Edit
public class Order {
    private OrderId id;
    private List<OrderItem> items; // children, not accessed directly
}
🔶 Repository
Provides access to aggregates (like a DAO), but focused on domain terms, not persistence tech.

java
Copy
Edit
public interface OrderRepository {
    Order findById(OrderId id);
    void save(Order order);
}
🔷 Service
Contains domain logic that doesn't fit naturally in an Entity or Value Object.

java
Copy
Edit
public class PaymentService {
    public void processPayment(Order order, PaymentDetails details) { ... }
}
🔷 Domain Event
Something that happens in the domain that other parts of the system might need to react to.

java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderPlacedEvent {
    private final OrderId orderId;
}
🔷 Bounded Context
Defines boundaries around a domain model — within a context, terms and logic are consistent.

Example: “Order” might mean different things in “Billing” vs “Shipping”.

📦 Layered Architecture in DDD
java
Copy
Edit
Presentation Layer (UI/API)
   ↓
Application Layer (use cases)
   ↓
Domain Layer (Entities, Aggregates, Services)
   ↓
Infrastructure Layer (DB, external APIs)
✅ Benefits of DDD
Aligns code with business concepts

Improves maintainability and scalability

Encourages clear boundaries and separation of concerns

🧠 When to Use DDD?
Use DDD when:

Your domain is complex and business rules are central

You want close collaboration with domain experts

You expect the system to evolve significantly over time

Avoid DDD if:

Your application is CRUD-heavy with minimal logic (DDD might be overkill)

Absolutely — let's go deeper into Domain-Driven Design (DDD), especially with examples to show how you'd structure and think about a real-world system.

🛒 Real-World Example: E-commerce (Order Management)
Let’s model an order placement and payment process using DDD.

🏗️ Domain Modeling Overview
Domain: ECommerce
Core subdomains (bounded contexts):

Order Management

Inventory

Payments

Shipping

Customer Profile

We’ll focus on Order Management here.

🔶 Value Object: ProductItem
java
Copy
Edit
public class ProductItem {
    private final String productId;
    private final int quantity;

    public ProductItem(String productId, int quantity) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    // equals and hashCode implemented by value
}
🔷 Entity: Order
java
Copy
Edit
public class Order {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerId;
    private final List<ProductItem> items;
    private OrderStatus status;

    public Order(String orderId, String customerId, List<ProductItem> items) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.items = items;
        this.status = OrderStatus.CREATED;
    }

    public void markAsPaid() {
        if (status != OrderStatus.CREATED) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot pay for order in status: " + status);
        }
        this.status = OrderStatus.PAID;
    }

    // getters
}
🔧 Enum: OrderStatus
java
Copy
Edit
public enum OrderStatus {
    CREATED, PAID, SHIPPED, CANCELLED
}
🧠 Domain Service: OrderPlacementService
java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderPlacementService {
    private final InventoryService inventoryService;
    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;

    public OrderPlacementService(InventoryService inventoryService, OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.inventoryService = inventoryService;
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public Order placeOrder(String customerId, List<ProductItem> items) {
        if (!inventoryService.areAvailable(items)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("One or more items are out of stock");
        }
        Order order = new Order(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), customerId, items);
        orderRepository.save(order);
        return order;
    }
}
🗃️ Repository Interface
java
Copy
Edit
public interface OrderRepository {
    void save(Order order);
    Optional<Order> findById(String orderId);
}
In Infrastructure Layer, you'd have JpaOrderRepository or MongoOrderRepository implementing this.

🔔 Domain Event: OrderPlacedEvent
java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderPlacedEvent {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerId;

    public OrderPlacedEvent(String orderId, String customerId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
    }

    // publish to Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.
}
🧱 Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language
Within OrderManagement, "order" means a customer purchase request.

In Shipping, an "order" might refer to a shipment unit.

We use the ubiquitous language agreed upon with domain experts: terms like "order," "item," "paid," "cancelled" have precise meanings in this context.

📦 Application Layer vs Domain Layer
Application Layer orchestrates use cases: e.g., place order, pay for order.

Domain Layer holds business rules: e.g., rules for order status transitions.

✅ Why DDD Works Well Here
You can evolve the domain logic independently of technical concerns.

Each bounded context can be developed and deployed independently.

Business logic becomes more explicit, testable, and aligned with real-world rules.

📚 DDD Summary in Practice
Layer	Contains
Domain Layer	Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services, Events
Application Layer	Use case orchestration (e.g., OrderPlacementService)
Infrastructure Layer	DB access, message queues, external API integration
Presentation Layer	REST controllers, UI
