why would we prefer mongo db for faster writes than sql ? give strong reasons



3/3

ChatGPT said:
We may prefer MongoDB over SQL (like MySQL/PostgreSQL) for faster writes in certain scenarios due to several strong architectural and design differences:

NoSQL prefer availability and partition tolerance.
SQL prefer consistenvy and partition tolerance.

üîπ 1. Schema-less / Flexible Schema
MongoDB doesn't enforce a strict schema, so documents can vary in structure.

This reduces overhead during insert/update operations compared to SQL, where altering schemas or inserting into strict tables can be costly.

üîπ 2. No Joins (Denormalized Data Model)
In MongoDB, related data is often embedded in a single document (denormalization), reducing the need for multi-table joins on writes.

In SQL, related data often requires foreign key inserts across multiple tables, which slows down writes.

üîπ 3. Memory-Mapped Storage (WiredTiger Engine)
MongoDB‚Äôs WiredTiger storage engine uses memory-mapped files and compression, which enables faster writes with better I/O efficiency.

üîπ 4. Asynchronous Writes (Write Concerns)
MongoDB allows configurable write concerns. You can write with:, sql is synchronous

w: 0 (no acknowledgment)

w: 1 (acknowledge after primary write)

This makes writes non-blocking, unlike SQL where ACID guarantees often block until commit.

üîπ 5. Document-Based Model
MongoDB stores data as BSON (Binary JSON) documents.

Writing a single document is often faster than writing across multiple normalized SQL tables.

üîπ 6. Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)
MongoDB supports native sharding for horizontal scaling, spreading writes across shards automatically.

SQL systems often require complex setup or external tools for horizontal write scaling.

üîπ 7. No Transactions by Default (Optional in MongoDB)
MongoDB avoids multi-document transactions unless explicitly used.

SQL databases wrap many operations in transactions, adding overhead during writes, read isolation, write isolation, prevent phantom or dirty reads.
so that 2 threads dont write at the same time.

üîπ 8. Write Performance Tuned for High-Volume Ingest
MongoDB is optimized for high-throughput applications like logs, IoT, or clickstream data.

SQL databases focus more on consistency and relationships, making them slower under high write pressure.

why no sql is preferred over sql for horizontal scaling  when we can use EC2 for scaling sql dbs? technical aspects


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 20s
Short answer: you can scale SQL on EC2, but it‚Äôs usually harder, costlier, and less flexible for high write-throughput or globally distributed workloads. NoSQL systems are designed for horizontal scale (sharding, replication, weaker/adjustable consistency, simple data access patterns), whereas classic RDBMSes assume strong ACID semantics, joins and schema normalization ‚Äî things that fight horizontal partitioning. 
MongoDB
Database Administrators Stack Exchange

Here are the concrete technical reasons ‚Äî with examples and mitigation options when you must stay relational.

ACID + joins = data locality problems
Relational apps rely on joins and multi-row transactions. When you partition (shard) the data across nodes those joins often become ‚Äúcross-shard‚Äù operations, which either (a) require fetching and joining data across nodes (slow), or (b) force you to co-locate related rows (complex sharding keys). Maintaining ACID across shards also needs distributed commit/coordination (two-phase commit, Paxos/Raft interactions) which adds latency and complexity. 
Database Administrators Stack Exchange
BMC

Writes don‚Äôt scale as easily as reads
You can scale reads with replicas (read replicas on multiple EC2 instances) fairly straightforwardly. But scaling writes requires either a single stronger master (vertical scale) or partitioning writes across many masters (sharding). NoSQL engines were often built from day one to accept many concurrent writers across nodes; traditional RDBMSs weren‚Äôt, so write-scaling needs extra engineering. 
Stack Overflow

Operational complexity of sharding a SQL DB on EC2
You can run MySQL/Postgres on many EC2 instances and implement sharding at the app layer or with middleware, but that shifts complexity into your team: routing logic, resharding, schema migrations across shards, cross-shard transactions, backups, rebalancing, monitoring, etc. It‚Äôs doable (Vitess, Citus and other tools exist) but it‚Äôs more engineering-heavy than firing up a clustered NoSQL node which handles sharding/replication internally.

CAP / latency tradeoffs and geography
In distributed settings (multiple AZs / regions), you must trade consistency vs availability when partitions/latency happen. Many NoSQL systems expose eventual/weak consistency which lets them continue to accept writes locally and then replicate ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big win for geo-scale write throughput. If you insist on strong global consistency with SQL semantics, you either accept higher latencies or use specialized distributed-SQL systems (e.g., Spanner, CockroachDB) that implement complex protocols to provide both. Those systems solve the problem but are more complex and often more costly. 
BMC

Hotspots, uneven partitioning and secondary indexes
Practical sharding problems: uneven key distribution (hot shards), maintaining secondary indexes across shards, and performing global aggregates. NoSQL designs often accept denormalization (duplicate data) so most queries are local to a shard. In SQL you often rely on normalized schemas and secondary indexes that become expensive to keep consistent across shards. 
Database Administrators Stack Exchange

When scaling SQL on EC2 makes sense

Your workload has modest scale and strong relational/transaction needs ‚Üí vertical scale + read replicas is simpler/cost-effective.

You can design a sharding key that maps most traffic to single shards and avoid cross-shard joins.

You‚Äôre willing to adopt distributed-SQL/newSQL (CockroachDB, Yugabyte, Spanner) or middleware (Vitess/Citus) to keep SQL semantics while gaining horizontal scale. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
cockroachlabs.com

When NoSQL is preferred

Massive write throughput, wide geographic distribution, or very large amounts of semi-structured data with simple access patterns (get/put, key-based queries, document lookups).

You can accept relaxed consistency models or design eventual-consistency in your application. 
MongoDB

Practical takeaway (TL;DR)

EC2 + traditional SQL = good for vertical scaling and read-scaling (replicas).

For large-scale write-heavy / global workloads, NoSQL or distributed-SQL/newSQL is often a simpler, more robust horizontal-scaling choice because those systems were engineered for partitioning, replication and availability.

If you must keep SQL semantics, consider managed distributed-SQL (Spanner/Cockroach/Yugabyte) or proven middleware (Vitess/Citus) ‚Äî but expect higher operational/cost complexity than using a typical NoSQL cluster.

If you want, I can:
‚Ä¢ sketch a concrete sharding strategy for your schema (what to shard on, how to route queries), or
‚Ä¢ compare costs and ops effort for: (A) big EC2 vertical/replica approach, (B) app-level sharding + Postgres, (C) moving to Mongo/Cassandra, (D) using CockroachDB/Spanner ‚Äî using your expected RPS, dataset size, and consistency needs. Which do you want?

why is sql not suitable for horizontal scaling
Why SQL databases present challenges for horizontal scaling
While SQL databases are known for their data integrity and structured approach, they face inherent limitations when it comes to horizontal scaling, which involves adding more servers to distribute the database load. 
Here's why traditional SQL databases are not ideally suited for horizontal scaling:
1. ACID properties and transactional overhead
Maintaining ACID guarantees: SQL databases are built on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions. However, achieving strict ACID compliance across multiple servers in a distributed environment becomes computationally expensive and introduces latency.
Distributed transaction complexity: Ensuring atomicity (all or nothing) for transactions spanning multiple shards (data partitions across different servers) requires complex protocols like Two-Phase Commit (2PC) or Paxos, which can significantly slow down performance. 
2. Schema rigidity and join operations
Fixed schema challenges: SQL databases rely on a predefined schema, which can be difficult to manage and synchronize across multiple nodes in a horizontally scaled setup.
Inefficient distributed joins: Complex queries involving joins across tables become inefficient when data is distributed across multiple servers, potentially requiring data movement or distributed join processing which can degrade performance. 
3. The CAP theorem and consistency/availability trade-off
Prioritizing consistency over availability: SQL databases, in most cases, prioritize strong consistency to maintain data integrity. However, the CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance simultaneously. This means that when facing network partitions in a horizontally scaled system, ensuring consistency might necessitate compromising on availability (temporarily making data unavailable to prevent inconsistencies).
NoSQL alternatives and eventual consistency: NoSQL databases, designed with horizontal scaling in mind, often favor availability and partition tolerance by adopting eventual consistency models, where data might be temporarily inconsistent but eventually converges to the correct state. 
4. Sharding and its complexities
Manual sharding and maintenance: While sharding (dividing a database into smaller parts and distributing them across multiple servers) is a common technique to horizontally scale SQL databases, it often requires significant manual intervention for configuring, managing, and rebalancing shards.
Shard key selection challenges: Choosing an appropriate shard key is crucial for distributing data evenly and avoiding performance bottlenecks (hotspots) where certain shards become overloaded. 
In essence
While SQL databases can achieve a degree of horizontal scaling, it often comes with significant complexities and trade-offs, particularly regarding maintaining data consistency and managing distributed operations effectively. 
Note: Newer distributed SQL databases (NewSQL) like CockroachDB and Google Spanner aim to overcome these limitations by offering features that enable horizontal scaling while still maintaining strong consistency and transactional integrity. However, traditional SQL databases are generally better suited for vertical scaling (upgrading the resources of a single server) for many use cases.

why is sql not suitable for horizontal scaling
Great question, Shivani ‚Äî and one that hits at the heart of architectural decisions when building scalable systems. SQL databases (especially traditional relational ones like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle) are often not ideal for horizontal scaling due to several inherent design characteristics. Here's a breakdown:

‚öôÔ∏è Core Reasons SQL Struggles with Horizontal Scaling
1. Strong Consistency Guarantees
SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Ensuring consistency across distributed nodes is complex and slow, especially during writes.

Horizontal scaling often requires eventual consistency, which SQL isn't designed for.

2. Monolithic Schema and Joins
SQL relies heavily on normalized schemas and complex joins.

Distributing related data across nodes makes joins expensive and inefficient.

Sharding (splitting data across nodes) breaks the relational model, making queries harder to optimize.

3. Stateful Architecture
SQL databases maintain stateful connections and transaction logs.

Replicating state across nodes introduces latency and synchronization issues.

Stateless systems (like many NoSQL databases) are easier to scale horizontally.

4. Write Bottlenecks
Most SQL databases use a single master node for writes.

This creates a bottleneck as traffic grows.

While read replicas help, write scalability remains limited without complex clustering.

5. Complex Sharding Logic
Manual sharding in SQL is error-prone and hard to maintain.

You need to handle cross-shard queries, rebalancing, and failover logic yourself.

NoSQL systems often have built-in sharding and partitioning.

---------------------




why is sql not suitable for horizontal scalingSQL databases, or relational databases, face challenges with horizontal scaling due to their design and core principles. Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers (nodes) to distribute the workload, as opposed to vertical scaling, which involves upgrading a single server's resources. Here's why SQL databases are not inherently suited for horizontal scaling:

ACID Compliance: SQL databases prioritize ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity. Maintaining these guarantees across multiple nodes requires complex coordination (e.g., distributed transactions or two-phase commits), which introduces latency and overhead, making horizontal scaling less efficient.
Schema Rigidity: SQL databases rely on predefined schemas with structured tables and relationships (e.g., foreign keys). Distributing data across multiple nodes (sharding) often requires manual partitioning, which can break relational integrity or require costly cross-node joins, slowing down queries.
Joins and Complex Queries: SQL databases are optimized for complex queries involving joins, which are computationally expensive when data is spread across multiple nodes. Coordinating joins across distributed servers increases latency and complexity, undermining the benefits of horizontal scaling.
Data Consistency Challenges: To ensure consistency in a distributed SQL setup, mechanisms like distributed locks or consensus protocols are needed. These mechanisms add significant overhead, reducing the performance gains of adding more nodes.
Sharding Complexity: Horizontal scaling often involves sharding, where data is partitioned across nodes. In SQL databases, sharding is not automatic and requires application-level logic or middleware to manage data distribution, query routing, and rebalancing, which is complex and error-prone.
Replication Lag: SQL databases often use replication (e.g., master-slave or master-master) for scaling read operations. However, replication can introduce lag, where secondary nodes have slightly outdated data, leading to potential inconsistencies for read-heavy applications.

Why NoSQL Databases Are Often Preferred for Horizontal Scaling
NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) are designed with horizontal scaling in mind. They often sacrifice strict ACID compliance for eventual consistency, use flexible schemas, and support automatic sharding and partitioning, making it easier to distribute data across nodes without the overhead of complex coordination.
When SQL Can Scale Horizontally
SQL databases can scale horizontally to some extent with techniques like:

Read Replicas: Offloading read queries to secondary nodes, though this doesn‚Äôt address write scaling.
Sharding: Manually partitioning data, often with tools like Vitess or Citus.
Distributed SQL Databases: Modern SQL databases like CockroachDB or YugabyteDB are built for horizontal scaling, using distributed architectures that maintain SQL compatibility while addressing traditional limitations.

However, these solutions often require significant engineering effort or specialized systems compared to NoSQL‚Äôs native support for horizontal scaling.
If you‚Äôd like me to dive deeper into a specific aspect (e.g., sharding strategies, distributed SQL databases, or a comparison with NoSQL), let me know!1.5swhat is NoSQL‚Äôs native support for horizontal scaling.NoSQL databases are designed with native support for horizontal scaling, allowing them to efficiently distribute data and workload across multiple servers (nodes) by adding more machines to handle increased demand. This is a key reason they are often preferred for large-scale, high-traffic applications. Here‚Äôs how NoSQL databases achieve native support for horizontal scaling:

Flexible Data Models:

NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) use flexible, schema-less data models like key-value, document, column-family, or graph structures. Unlike SQL‚Äôs rigid relational schemas, these models don‚Äôt rely heavily on complex relationships (e.g., foreign keys), making it easier to partition and distribute data across nodes without breaking dependencies.


Automatic Sharding:

Many NoSQL databases natively support sharding, where data is automatically partitioned into smaller chunks (shards) and distributed across nodes. For example:

MongoDB uses a shard key to distribute documents across clusters, with built-in mechanisms to balance data and queries.
Cassandra partitions data using a partition key and a consistent hashing algorithm, ensuring even data distribution.


Sharding is typically transparent to the application, reducing the need for manual intervention compared to SQL databases.


Eventual Consistency:

NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency (following the CAP theorem). They use eventual consistency models, where updates propagate to all nodes over time. This reduces the need for costly coordination mechanisms (like distributed transactions in SQL), allowing nodes to operate independently and scale out efficiently.


Distributed Architecture:

NoSQL systems are built with distributed architectures in mind. For example:

Cassandra uses a peer-to-peer model with no single point of failure, where every node can handle reads and writes, enabling seamless scaling by adding nodes.
DynamoDB automatically distributes data across multiple servers in a cloud environment, handling scaling transparently.


This contrasts with traditional SQL databases, which often rely on a single primary node for writes, creating bottlenecks.


Replication for Read Scaling:

NoSQL databases natively support replication, where data is copied across multiple nodes to handle read-heavy workloads. For example:

MongoDB uses replica sets to provide high availability and distribute read queries.
Cassandra allows tunable consistency, letting developers choose how many nodes must acknowledge a read or write, balancing performance and consistency.


Replication is designed to scale linearly with additional nodes, improving read performance without significant overhead.


Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling:

NoSQL databases often include built-in load balancing to distribute queries evenly across nodes. For example, Cassandra‚Äôs consistent hashing ensures that data and queries are spread uniformly.
Cloud-native NoSQL databases like DynamoDB or Google Cloud Bigtable offer auto-scaling, dynamically adjusting the number of nodes based on workload, which simplifies horizontal scaling for developers.


Simplified Query Patterns:

NoSQL databases are optimized for simpler, key-based queries rather than complex relational joins, which are computationally expensive in distributed systems. This makes it easier to execute queries across distributed nodes without significant performance degradation.



Examples of NoSQL Databases with Strong Horizontal Scaling

Cassandra: Uses a ring-based architecture with consistent hashing for automatic data partitioning and replication, ideal for write-heavy workloads.
MongoDB: Supports sharding and replica sets, allowing horizontal scaling for both reads and writes.
DynamoDB: Provides serverless scaling, automatically distributing data and handling load increases in AWS‚Äôs cloud.
Redis: Scales horizontally via clustering (e.g., Redis Cluster), distributing key-value pairs across nodes.

Why This Matters
NoSQL‚Äôs native support for horizontal scaling makes it ideal for applications with massive data volumes, high write/read throughput, or unpredictable growth (e.g., social media platforms, IoT, or real-time analytics). By contrast, traditional SQL databases require complex workarounds (e.g., manual sharding or distributed SQL systems) to achieve similar scalability, which often come with trade-offs in performance or complexity.
If you‚Äôd like a deeper dive into a specific NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra‚Äôs ring architecture or MongoDB‚Äôs sharding), a comparison with SQL scaling techniques, or a use-case analysis, let me know!




------------------------




DynamoDB: Provides serverless scaling, automatically distributing data and handling load increases in AWS‚Äôs cloud.
Yes, your statement accurately summarizes two key advantages of Amazon DynamoDB: 
Serverless scaling: DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless database service, which means you don't need to provision, manage, or patch servers. It automatically adjusts its capacity to handle fluctuating workloads, scaling up or down as needed. This eliminates the need for manual capacity planning and allows you to pay only for the resources your application consumes.
Automatic data distribution and load handling: DynamoDB automatically distributes data across multiple partitions, which are stored on multiple servers. This horizontal scaling ensures high performance and availability, even as your data grows to massive scales. DynamoDB also handles workload increases automatically, preventing throttling and ensuring consistent performance, according to N2W Software. Adaptive capacity, a feature enabled by default, further optimizes performance by automatically increasing throughput for hot partitions. 
In essence, DynamoDB's serverless and automatic management features simplify database administration, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure. 



--------------------




Redis: Scales horizontally via clustering (e.g., Redis Cluster), distributing key-value pairs across nodes.


Redis Cluster is the official solution for achieving horizontal scaling and high availability in Redis. It enables the distribution of data across multiple Redis nodes, effectively creating a sharded dataset that can handle larger data volumes and higher throughput than a single Redis instance.
Key aspects of Redis Cluster:
Sharding (Hash Slots):
Redis Cluster divides the entire keyspace into 16,384 hash slots. Each key is mapped to a specific hash slot using a CRC16 algorithm modulo 16384. These hash slots are then distributed among the master nodes in the cluster, with each master node responsible for a subset of the slots.
Master-Replica Architecture:
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, each master node in a Redis Cluster can have one or more replica nodes. If a master node fails, one of its replicas is automatically promoted to become the new master, ensuring continuous operation and data availability.
Automatic Shard Management:
Redis Cluster handles the automatic redistribution of hash slots when nodes are added or removed from the cluster. This allows for dynamic scaling without requiring downtime or manual data migration.
Client Redirection:
When a client attempts to access a key, the Redis Cluster client library determines the correct master node responsible for that key's hash slot and redirects the request accordingly.
Fault Tolerance:
The master-replica setup and automatic failover mechanisms ensure that the cluster can remain operational even if some nodes experience failures.
Benefits of Redis Cluster:
Horizontal Scalability:
Allows for scaling out by adding more nodes to handle increased data volume and traffic.
High Availability:
Provides automatic failover mechanisms to ensure continuous operation in case of node failures.
Improved Performance:
Distributes the workload across multiple nodes, leading to better performance for large datasets and high-traffic applications.

Writes don‚Äôt scale as easily as reads You can scale reads with replicas (read replicas on multiple EC2 instances) fairly straightforwardly. But scaling writes requires either a single stronger master (vertical scale) or partitioning writes across many masters (sharding). NoSQL engines were often built from day one to accept many concurrent writers across nodes; traditional RDBMSs weren‚Äôt, so write-scaling needs extra engineering.what does no sql to scale writes eaasily ?

NoSQL databases are designed to scale writes more easily than traditional RDBMSs primarily due to their architectural principles and data models, which prioritize horizontal scalability and distributed operations.
Here's how NoSQL facilitates easier write scaling:
Distributed Architecture and Sharding/Partitioning:
Many NoSQL databases are inherently designed for distributed environments. They achieve write scalability by automatically or easily supporting sharding or partitioning. This means data can be divided and distributed across multiple nodes or servers, with each node handling writes for its specific partition of data. This eliminates the bottleneck of a single master node for all writes.
Eventual Consistency:
Unlike RDBMSs that often enforce strong consistency (where all replicas must be updated before a write is confirmed), many NoSQL databases embrace eventual consistency. This allows writes to be acknowledged more quickly, as they don't need to wait for all replicas to be synchronized immediately. This significantly improves write throughput, especially in highly distributed systems.
Flexible Schema:
NoSQL databases often have flexible or schema-less data models. This flexibility reduces the overhead associated with schema changes and strict data validation, which can be a performance bottleneck in RDBMSs when handling high volumes of writes.
Optimized for Specific Workloads:
Different NoSQL databases are optimized for specific data models and access patterns (e.g., key-value stores, document databases, column-family databases, graph databases). This specialization often allows them to handle writes for their specific use case more efficiently than a general-purpose RDBMS.
Built-in Replication and Conflict Resolution:
NoSQL systems frequently include built-in mechanisms for replication across nodes and strategies for handling write conflicts in a distributed environment. This reduces the need for complex, custom engineering to manage write consistency and data availability in scaled-out architectures.

how cockroachDB optimises fast reads and fast writes with ACID properties and schema and joins efficiently

CockroachDB optimizes for fast reads and writes while maintaining ACID properties, handling schema, and executing joins efficiently through a combination of architectural features and optimizations:
1. Fast Reads and Writes with ACID Properties:
Distributed Transactions and Raft Consensus:
CockroachDB achieves ACID guarantees, including strong consistency (Serializable isolation by default), across a distributed cluster by using distributed transactions and the Raft consensus algorithm. Writes are committed only after a majority of replicas agree, ensuring durability and consistency.
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC):
MVCC allows reads to proceed without blocking writes, and writes to occur without blocking reads, by maintaining multiple versions of data. This enables high concurrency and provides the ability to query historical data using AS OF SYSTEM TIME.
Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC):
HLCs are used to efficiently order events in a distributed system, enabling faster reads than relying solely on Raft consensus for ordering.
Buffered Writes:
Recent optimizations like buffered writes reduce network round trips for write operations by keeping them local to the SQL coordinator before committing, especially beneficial for high-frequency write-read cycles. 
2. Efficient Schema Management:
Online Schema Changes: CockroachDB supports online, asynchronous schema changes, allowing tables to remain available for reads and writes during schema modifications. This is achieved by incrementally transitioning the schema and ensuring consistency across the cluster.
3. Join Optimization:
Cost-Based Optimizer:
CockroachDB employs a cost-based optimizer that analyzes queries and determines the most efficient execution plan, including how to perform joins.
Index Usage:
Efficient joins often rely on appropriate indexing. CockroachDB allows for the creation of indexes to speed up join operations by quickly locating matching rows.
Optimized Join Algorithms:
While early versions of CockroachDB's join implementation prioritized simplicity, ongoing development focuses on more performant algorithms for various join types, especially for larger datasets. Optimizations like using INNER JOIN where possible and avoiding SELECT DISTINCT on large tables are recommended for performance.
4. Data Locality and Replication:
Distributed Data Ranges:
Data is automatically sharded into ranges and distributed across the cluster. Each range has multiple replicas for fault tolerance and high availability.
"Follow the Workload" Logic:
CockroachDB dynamically adjusts the placement of leaseholders (the primary replica for a data range) based on workload patterns, aiming to reduce latency by placing the leaseholder closer to the accessing client.
By combining these elements, CockroachDB aims to provide a highly available, scalable, and performant distributed SQL database that maintains strong data integrity.
