why would we prefer mongo db for faster writes than sql ? give strong reasons



3/3

We may prefer MongoDB over SQL (like MySQL/PostgreSQL) for faster writes in certain scenarios due to several strong architectural and design differences:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Schema-less / Flexible Schema
MongoDB doesn't enforce a strict schema, so documents can vary in structure.

This reduces overhead during insert/update operations compared to SQL, where altering schemas or inserting into strict tables can be costly.

ðŸ”¹ 2. No Joins (Denormalized Data Model)
In MongoDB, related data is often embedded in a single document (denormalization), reducing the need for multi-table joins on writes.

In SQL, related data often requires foreign key inserts across multiple tables, which slows down writes.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Memory-Mapped Storage (WiredTiger Engine)
MongoDBâ€™s WiredTiger storage engine uses memory-mapped files and compression, which enables faster writes with better I/O efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Asynchronous Writes (Write Concerns)
MongoDB allows configurable write concerns. You can write with:, sql is synchronous

w: 0 (no acknowledgment)

w: 1 (acknowledge after primary write)

This makes writes non-blocking, unlike SQL where ACID guarantees often block until commit.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Document-Based Model
MongoDB stores data as BSON (Binary JSON) documents.

Writing a single document is often faster than writing across multiple normalized SQL tables.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)
MongoDB supports native sharding for horizontal scaling, spreading writes across shards automatically.

SQL systems often require complex setup or external tools for horizontal write scaling.

ðŸ”¹ 7. No Transactions by Default (Optional in MongoDB)
MongoDB avoids multi-document transactions unless explicitly used.

SQL databases wrap many operations in transactions, adding overhead during writes, read isolation, write isolation, prevent phantom or dirty reads.
so that 2 threads dont write at the same time.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Write Performance Tuned for High-Volume Ingest
MongoDB is optimized for high-throughput applications like logs, IoT, or clickstream data.

SQL databases focus more on consistency and relationships, making them slower under high write pressure.
