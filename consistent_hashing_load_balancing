what is load balacing
balancing  no of request on each server

why load balacing?
so that one server  doesnt  get hot and fail 

Hashing before?
When a new server is added , a part of request from server's quota was shifted to rest of each of the servers
which makes it ridiculous to maintain cache for each server.

Consistent Hashing?
Consistent Hashing solves the problem by shifting a part of load from one server to the new server. This helps to maintain cache.
