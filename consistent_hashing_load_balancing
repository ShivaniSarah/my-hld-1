what is load balacing
balancing  no of request on each server

why load balacing?
so that one server  doesnt  get hot and fail 

Hashing before?
When a new server is added /removed , a part of request from each server's quota was shifted to rest of each of the servers
which makes it ridiculous to maintain cache for each server.

Consistent Hashing?
Consistent Hashing solves the problem by shifting a part of load from few servers to the new server. This helps to maintain cache.

Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used,
only k/n keys need to be remapped on average, where k is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots. 
In contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped.
