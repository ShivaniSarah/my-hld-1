disadvantages of indexing ... is it where partitioning is used?

Good question üëç let‚Äôs break it down:

‚ö° Disadvantages of Indexing

While indexes speed up read queries, they come with costs:

Slower Writes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)

Every time data changes, all relevant indexes must also be updated.

This adds overhead, especially for write-heavy workloads.

Increased Storage Usage

Indexes consume additional disk space (sometimes 2x‚Äì3x the base table size if you index many columns).

Maintenance Overhead

Indexes can fragment over time and need periodic rebuilding/reorganizing to stay efficient.

More indexes ‚Üí higher DBA/infra cost.

Not Always Helpful

For small tables, full table scans can be faster.

If a query retrieves a large % of rows, indexes may not improve performance.

Complexity

Too many indexes can confuse the optimizer, leading to suboptimal query plans.

Choosing the wrong type of index (B-Tree, Hash, GIN, etc.) can actually degrade performance.

‚ö° Relation to Partitioning

üëâ Partitioning and Indexing are different techniques, but often used together:

Partitioning

Splits a large table into smaller pieces (by range, list, hash, etc.).

Helps manage very large datasets, making queries faster by scanning only relevant partitions.

Useful for time-series data, logs, or very big transactional tables.

Indexing

Provides fast lookup inside a table (or partition).

Even if you partition, you often still need indexes inside each partition for efficient queries.

‚úÖ When to Prefer Partitioning vs Indexing

Partitioning helps when:

Table is too large (billions of rows).

Queries usually target subsets (e.g., last month‚Äôs data).

Maintenance (archiving, deletion) needs to be efficient.

Indexing helps when:

Queries need fast random access to rows.

Dataset is not massive, but you need quick lookups.

You often filter/join on specific columns.

üîë They‚Äôre not replacements but complements:

Partitioning reduces the search space.

Indexing speeds up access inside each partition.



Perfect üëç let‚Äôs take a realistic SQL example and see where indexing and partitioning fit.

Example Scenario:

You have a transactions table with 500M rows:

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at DATE
);


This table stores all e-commerce transactions for years.

1. Without Indexing or Partitioning

Query:

SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
WHERE user_id = 12345;


Full table scan of 500M rows ‚Üí very slow.

2. Adding an Index
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON transactions(user_id);


Now:

SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
WHERE user_id = 12345;


Uses B-Tree index ‚Üí only fetches rows for that user quickly.

Great if you query by user_id often.

üëâ Problem: If you delete old transactions (say older than 5 years), the whole index still grows huge and is expensive to maintain.

3. Partitioning the Table

Partition by month (range partitioning):

CREATE TABLE transactions_2024_01 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE transactions_2024_02 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');

-- and so on...


Now:

SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28';


DB engine only scans Feb 2024 partition, not entire 500M rows.

Dropping old partitions (say, 2018 data) is just a DROP TABLE, very fast.

üëâ Problem: If you query by user_id (not time-based), partitioning alone won‚Äôt help.

4. Partitioning + Indexing Together ‚úÖ

Inside each partition, add an index:

CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_2024_01 ON transactions_2024_01(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_2024_02 ON transactions_2024_02(user_id);


Now queries benefit from both:

Time-based queries ‚Üí partition pruning.

User lookups ‚Üí local index search inside that partition.

Example:

SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
WHERE user_id = 12345 
  AND created_at BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28';


Execution:

Engine narrows down to Feb partition only.

Uses idx_user_id_2024_02 to find rows instantly.

üîë Key Takeaway:

Indexing = fast lookups.

Partitioning = manage huge tables efficiently.

Together = best performance on large-scale data.

üëâ Do you want me to also compare storage + write overhead differences between just indexing vs just partitioning vs both? That way you‚Äôll see the trade-offs clearly.

Great üëç let‚Äôs compare Indexing vs Partitioning vs Both across dimensions like storage, reads, writes, and maintenance.

| **Storage Usage**                            | High ‚Üí indexes can take 20‚Äì200% extra space (depends on number of indexes & column size).                       | Low ‚Üí partitions don‚Äôt need extra storage, just split the table.                                                              | Medium ‚Üí each partition has its own index (but smaller indexes than one giant global index).          |
| **Read Performance**                         | Fast for selective queries (e.g. `WHERE user_id = ...`). Slows down if table is huge and query scans many rows. | Fast for range queries (e.g. `WHERE created_at BETWEEN ...`).

| **Write Performance (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)** | Slower ‚Üí every index must be updated on each write. Heavy write load suffers.                                   | Good ‚Üí only relevant partition receives writes, no global index overhead.                                                     | Moderate ‚Üí writes only affect one partition, but still update that partition‚Äôs indexes.               |
| **Maintenance**                              | High ‚Üí indexes fragment, need rebuilds, take time on massive tables.                                            | Low ‚Üí old partitions can be dropped quickly (no need to rebuild giant indexes).                                               | Balanced ‚Üí still need to maintain per-partition indexes, but each is smaller and cheaper to maintain. |
| **Best Use Case**                            | Small/medium tables, frequent lookups by columns.                                                               | Very large tables (billions of rows), queries often filtered by time/range.                                                   | Huge tables with mixed query patterns (time + lookup).                                                |


üìå Example Use-Cases

Only Indexing

User database with 10M users.

Queries like WHERE email = ?.

Partitioning won‚Äôt help since data isn‚Äôt naturally range-based.

Only Partitioning

Log/event storage (billions of rows).

Queries like WHERE created_at BETWEEN ....

Indexing is less critical since queries always use time ranges.

Both

E-commerce transactions (billions of rows, many years).

Queries by user_id AND created_at.

Needs partitioning (to drop/archive old data) + indexing (to lookup within partitions).

üîë Rule of Thumb

If table < 50M rows ‚Üí indexing alone is usually enough.

If table > 500M rows ‚Üí partitioning becomes important.

If queries mix range + lookup ‚Üí use both.
