Indexing in NoSQL is based on sort key combination of composite key

Design a database with very efficient access times?

HashMap + Red Black tree can help in indexing

B and B+ trees also help in indexing used in SQL 

BST can get skewed to avoid it AVL and Red Black Trees are there.

An AVL tree defined as a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) 
where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.

Red Black tree
A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an additional attribute:
a color, which can be either red or black. The primary objective of these trees is to maintain balance during
insertions and deletions, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
