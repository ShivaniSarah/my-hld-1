Indexing in NoSQL is based on sort key combination of composite key

Design a database with very efficient access times?

HashMap + Red Black tree can help in indexing in O(1)

B and B+ trees also help in indexing used in SQL 

BST can get skewed to avoid it AVL and Red Black Trees are there.

An AVL tree defined as a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) 
where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.

Red Black tree
A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an additional attribute:
a color, which can be either red or black. The primary objective of these trees is to maintain balance during
insertions and deletions, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Storing values within the index
The key in an index is the thing that queries search for, but the value can be one of
two things: it could be the actual row (document, vertex) in question, or it could be a
reference to the row stored elsewhere. In the latter case, the place where rows are
stored is known as a heap file, and it stores data in no particular order (it may be
append-only, or it may keep track of deleted rows in order to overwrite them with
new data later). The heap file approach is common because it avoids duplicating data
when multiple secondary indexes are present: each index just references a location in
the heap file, and the actual data is kept in one place.
When updating a value without changing the key, the heap file approach can be quite
efficient: the record can be overwritten in place, provided that the new value is not
larger than the old value. The situation is more complicated if the new value is larger,
as it probably needs to be moved to a new location in the heap where there is enough
space. In that case, either all indexes need to be updated to point at the new heap
location of the record, or a forwarding pointer is left behind in the old heap location
[5].
In some situations, the extra hop from the index to the heap file is too much of a per‐
formance penalty for reads, so it can be desirable to store the indexed row directly
within an index. This is known as a clustered index. For example, in MySQL’s
InnoDB storage engine, the primary key of a table is always a clustered index, and
secondary indexes refer to the primary key (rather than a heap file location) [31]. In
SQL Server, you can specify one clustered index per table [32].
A compromise between a clustered index (storing all row data within the index) and
a nonclustered index (storing only references to the data within the index) is known
as a covering index or index with included columns, which stores some of a table’s col‐
umns within the index [33]. This allows some queries to be answered by using the
index alone (in which case, the index is said to cover the query) [32].
86 | Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval
As with any kind of duplication of data, clustered and covering indexes can speed up
reads, but they require additional storage and can add overhead on writes. Databases
also need to go to additional effort to enforce transactional guarantees, because appli‐
cations should not see inconsistencies due to the duplication.

This passage is explaining different ways databases can store data inside an index — and how that choice affects read speed, write performance, and storage requirements.

Let’s break it down step-by-step.

1. What’s stored in an index?
When you create an index, it has:

Key → the value the database searches on (e.g., username, id, email).

Value → what the index points to.

Two main options for what the value is:

Option A: Heap file reference (non-clustered index)
The index value is just a pointer to where the full row is stored in a separate file called the heap file.

Heap file → stores rows in no particular order (could be append-only or reuse space from deleted rows).

Benefits:

Avoids storing the same row in multiple indexes → saves space when you have multiple indexes.

Easy to update if the data changes (as long as size doesn’t grow).

Drawbacks:

Every read needs two steps:

Find row location from the index.

Fetch the row from the heap file.

Updating rows:

If new value fits in old space → overwrite in place.

If new value is larger → must move row to new heap location.

Either update all indexes pointing to it, or

Leave a forwarding pointer at the old location.

Option B: Store the full row in the index (clustered index)
The index contains both the key and all columns of the row.

No need for a heap file → the data itself is in the index structure.

Example:

In MySQL InnoDB → The primary key is a clustered index.

In SQL Server → You can choose one clustered index per table.

Benefit:

Faster reads → no extra lookup step.

Drawback:

More storage (since data is duplicated if there are multiple indexes).

Slower writes → every update to data means updating the clustered index.

Option C: Hybrid (covering index / index with included columns)
Index stores key + some columns of the table (not all).

Allows certain queries to be answered entirely from the index (the query is “covered” by the index).

Example:

If index is (last_name, first_name, age) and your query only needs those three columns, it never touches the heap or clustered index.

Benefit:

Faster for specific queries.

Drawback:

Still more storage.

Still adds write overhead.

2. Trade-offs

| Type of Index        | Read Speed                  | Write Speed                              | Storage Usage    | Notes                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Heap + Non-clustered | Slower (needs extra lookup) | Faster for updates (no data duplication) | Smaller          | Most common for secondary indexes |
| Clustered            | Fastest (data in index)     | Slower (index update on every change)    | Larger           | MySQL InnoDB PK is clustered      |
| Covering             | Fast for certain queries    | Slower than heap for writes              | Larger than heap | Only covers some queries          |


✅ Key takeaway:

Heap file + non-clustered index → efficient writes, smaller storage, but extra lookup on reads.

Clustered index → fastest reads, but more storage + slower writes.

Covering index → good middle ground for specific queries, but still uses more storage.

If you want, I can make you a visual diagram showing heap files, clustered indexes, and covering indexes so it’s easier to picture how data flows during a query. Would you like me to do that?

and the above was for indexingin sql or no sql ?


The explanation you posted is describing index storage strategies in relational databases (SQL) — but the same concepts can also appear in some NoSQL systems.

Why it’s mainly SQL-focused
Terms like primary key, secondary index, clustered index, and covering index are standard in RDBMSs like:

MySQL (InnoDB)

SQL Server

PostgreSQL (though PostgreSQL doesn’t have a true clustered index by default)

The discussion about heap files vs clustered storage is directly related to how SQL engines store table rows.

In NoSQL
Some NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase) also have indexes — but:

Their default storage engines often work differently.

They may use LSM-trees or SSTables (append-only sorted files) instead of B+ trees and heap files.

Indexes in NoSQL may store document/row data inline or just an object ID (similar to heap pointers).

In systems like MongoDB, the _id index is kind of like a clustered index because documents are stored in _id order in WiredTiger’s B-tree.

So:

This explanation was written in the context of SQL indexing (especially MySQL & SQL Server).

NoSQL systems can still use clustered-like or non-clustered-like indexes, but their underlying mechanics are often different — and many use storage engines optimized for high write throughput (e.g., LSM-trees) rather than heap files.

If you want, I can make you a side-by-side table comparing SQL indexing (heap/clustered/covering) vs NoSQL indexing (LSM, document store indexes) so you can see exactly where they overlap and where they differ.



---------



Here’s the side-by-side comparison of SQL indexing vs NoSQL indexing so you can clearly see overlaps and differences:


SQL vs NoSQL Index Storage Approaches
| Feature / Concept          | **SQL (Relational DBs)**                                                                          | **NoSQL (Document/Key-Value/Column Stores)**                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typical Storage Engine** | **B+ Trees + Heap File** (e.g., MySQL InnoDB, SQL Server)                                         | **LSM-Trees / SSTables** (e.g., Cassandra, LevelDB, RocksDB) or B-Trees (e.g., MongoDB WiredTiger)               |
| **Row/Document Location**  | Non-clustered index stores **pointer** to row in heap file; clustered index stores **row inline** | Many store **document ID** in index; data in separate SSTable or inline if clustered-like                        |
| **Clustered Index**        | Stores **entire row** in index, sorted by primary key                                             | Equivalent concept in some NoSQL: MongoDB stores documents in B-tree keyed by `_id` (clustered-like behavior)    |
| **Non-Clustered Index**    | Stores key + pointer to row in heap                                                               | Stores key + document ID; then fetches from main storage file/table                                              |
| **Covering Index**         | Stores key + some extra columns so query can be answered from index only                          | Similar idea: MongoDB supports **covered queries** where index includes all needed fields                        |
| **Updates**                | If row grows beyond original space in heap → move & update pointers                               | In LSM-tree systems, updates create new versions in memtable, eventually flushed to SSTable (no in-place update) |
| **Writes Performance**     | Slower for clustered indexes due to data movement; heap + non-clustered faster                    | Often optimized for writes (especially LSM-based) since data is appended, not updated in place                   |
| **Read Performance**       | Clustered indexes fastest; non-clustered require extra heap lookup                                | LSM-trees may require multiple SSTable lookups; use Bloom filters & compaction to speed up reads                 |
| **Multiple Indexes**       | Secondary indexes point to heap location or primary key                                           | Secondary indexes point to document ID or partition key                                                          |
| **Data Locality**          | Clustered index keeps related rows physically close                                               | NoSQL often keeps rows/documents in partitioned SSTables or in the same shard for locality                       |

Key Takeaways
SQL indexes are usually B+ tree-based with a choice of clustered or non-clustered.

NoSQL indexes can be B-tree-like (e.g., MongoDB) or LSM-tree-based (e.g., Cassandra, HBase), with optimizations for write-heavy workloads.

Both worlds have covering indexes, but in NoSQL they’re often called covered queries or projections.

Heap files are common in SQL, but rare in modern NoSQL — LSM-trees avoid in-place updates entirely.

If you want, I can draw a visual diagram showing the storage flow for:

SQL heap + non-clustered index

SQL clustered index

NoSQL LSM-tree index
so you can see how the read/write path changes.
