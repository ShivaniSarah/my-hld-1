design at high level  dish recommendation system


ChatGPT said:
Designing a Dish Recommendation System involves defining how users receive relevant, personalized food recommendations based on their preferences, past interactions, and contextual factors (like time of day, dietary needs, location, etc.).

🎯 Goals
Recommend dishes users are likely to enjoy

Personalize based on user preferences, history, and context

Support cold-start for new users or dishes

Allow filtering (e.g., vegetarian, spicy, under 500 calories)

Optimize for user engagement and diversity

🔧 Core Modules
1. User Profile Service
Age, gender, dietary preferences

Cuisine likes/dislikes

Location (optional)

Allergy info

Implicit preferences (from past orders/ratings)

2. Dish Metadata Service
Name, ingredients, cuisine, calories, tags

Nutritional information

User ratings

Image & description

3. Interaction Tracker
Tracks views, clicks, orders, likes/dislikes, ratings

Stores time, device, location, etc.

4. Recommendation Engine
Collaborative Filtering:

Users who liked similar dishes

Matrix factorization / ALS / nearest-neighbors

Content-Based Filtering:

Based on dish ingredients, tags, nutritional info

Cosine similarity or embeddings

Hybrid Model:

Combines CF + content + context + popularity

5. Ranking & Scoring
Contextual bandits or ML models to rank:

Dish relevance

Diversity

Novelty

Freshness (recency)

Explore vs exploit

6. Cold Start Solutions
For new users: Ask preferences or use popularity-based/default cuisine

For new dishes: Use content similarity to known popular dishes

🚀 Scalability & Performance
Caching: Cache top-N recommendations for users

Batch + Real-time:

Batch training nightly

Real-time scoring on user interaction

Feature Store: Store processed user/dish features

A/B Testing Framework: For testing recommendation strategies

🔐 Privacy & Ethics
Handle sensitive info like dietary restrictions carefully

Provide opt-out and data download options

Avoid biases (e.g., over-recommending based on limited past)

🔌 Extensibility
Add restaurant-specific recommendations

Support for combo recommendations (dish + drink)

Support for dynamic pricing/promotions

Feedback loop to improve recommendations over time
