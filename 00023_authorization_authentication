üõ°Ô∏è Authorization
"What are you allowed to do?"

‚úÖ You are authorized if the system allows you to perform specific actions based on your role or privileges.

üß≠ Key Differences


| Feature       | Authentication                  | Authorization                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Checks        | User's identity                 | User's access rights                |
| Happens when? | First step                      | After authentication                |
| Determines    | **Who** you are                 | **What** you can do                 |
| Example       | Logging in                      | Accessing a restricted page         |
| Data handled  | Credentials (passwords, tokens) | Permissions, roles, access policies |
| Returns       | Identity (e.g., user ID)        | Access granted/denied               |



üîÑ Relationship:
You must be authenticated before you can be authorized.

Authentication does not imply authorization.
