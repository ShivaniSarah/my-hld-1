Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems ? -> isolation trees


ChatGPT said:
Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems is critical for identifying unexpected behavior such as slowdowns, failures, or security breaches. Due to the system‚Äôs complexity, scale, and asynchronous nature, detecting anomalies requires a mix of statistical, machine learning, and rule-based techniques.

‚úÖ Key Challenges
Challenge	Description
Scale & Volume	High cardinality of logs/metrics across services/nodes.
Heterogeneity	Different services, protocols, and hardware configurations.
Asynchronous Failures	Delayed symptoms or root causes spread across the system.
Data Noise	Transient spikes may not be true anomalies.
Contextual Variability	What‚Äôs normal during peak hours may be anomalous during off-peak.

üîç What to Monitor
System-level metrics

CPU, memory, disk, network usage

Host health, container status

Service/application-level metrics

Latency, error rate, throughput

Queue lengths, retry rates

Logs and traces

Unusual log patterns or trace durations

Distributed Tracing

Abnormal spans, missing spans, or timing bottlenecks

üß† Anomaly Detection Techniques
1. Rule-Based Thresholding
Simple thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%)

Works for known failure patterns

Fast and explainable, but rigid

2. Statistical Models
Z-score, moving average, exponential smoothing

Detects sudden spikes or deviations

Low complexity, but struggles with seasonal or contextual anomalies

3. Time-Series ML Models
ARIMA, Holt-Winters, SARIMA

Good for periodic patterns

Require tuning and stationary data

4. Unsupervised ML
Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM, LOF

Detect rare behaviors without labels

Common for high-dimensional metrics (e.g., 100+ KPIs across nodes)

5. Deep Learning
Autoencoders: Reconstruct normal behavior, flag high reconstruction error

LSTM/GRU: Model temporal dependencies in sequences

GANs: Learn distribution of normal behavior and detect deviations

6. Graph-Based Anomaly Detection
For systems with service dependencies or topologies (e.g., service meshes)

Use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or spectral analysis
