Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems ? -> isolation trees

Sure ‚Äî here‚Äôs a vague story representing the Holt-Winters algorithm:
Imagine a shopkeeper tracking sales over time. She notices that her sales follow three patterns: a base level that changes slowly, an overall upward or downward trend, and repeating seasonal cycles ‚Äî like higher sales during holidays.
Each day, she updates her expectations using:
What she sold today compared to the same season in the past,
How her sales are trending lately,
And how strong the season's effect is.
With each new day, she adjusts her beliefs about these three patterns ‚Äî level, trend, and seasonality ‚Äî and uses them to predict the future. If actual sales ever deviate too much from her forecast, she suspects something unusual is happening.
Let me know if you want a metaphor in a different setting (e.g., weather, traffic, etc.).
The vague idea behind the Holt-Winters algorithm is:
It tries to understand how a value changes over time by looking at three things: the overall level, the direction it‚Äôs moving (trend), and any repeating patterns (seasonality). Then it uses these patterns to guess what might happen next.

Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems is critical for identifying unexpected behavior such as slowdowns, failures, or security breaches. Due to the system‚Äôs complexity, scale, and asynchronous nature, detecting anomalies requires a mix of statistical, machine learning, and rule-based techniques.

‚úÖ Key Challenges
Challenge	Description
Scale & Volume	High cardinality of logs/metrics across services/nodes.
Heterogeneity	Different services, protocols, and hardware configurations.
Asynchronous Failures	Delayed symptoms or root causes spread across the system.
Data Noise	Transient spikes may not be true anomalies.
Contextual Variability	What‚Äôs normal during peak hours may be anomalous during off-peak.

üîç What to Monitor
System-level metrics

CPU, memory, disk, network usage

Host health, container status

Service/application-level metrics

Latency, error rate, throughput

Queue lengths, retry rates

Logs and traces

Unusual log patterns or trace durations

Distributed Tracing

Abnormal spans, missing spans, or timing bottlenecks

üß† Anomaly Detection Techniques
1. Rule-Based Thresholding
Simple thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%)

Works for known failure patterns

Fast and explainable, but rigid

2. Statistical Models
Z-score, moving average, exponential smoothing

Detects sudden spikes or deviations

Low complexity, but struggles with seasonal or contextual anomalies

3. Time-Series ML Models
ARIMA, Holt-Winters, SARIMA

Good for periodic patterns

Require tuning and stationary data

4. Unsupervised ML
Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM, LOF

Detect rare behaviors without labels

Common for high-dimensional metrics (e.g., 100+ KPIs across nodes)

5. Deep Learning
Autoencoders: Reconstruct normal behavior, flag high reconstruction error

LSTM/GRU: Model temporal dependencies in sequences

GANs: Learn distribution of normal behavior and detect deviations

6. Graph-Based Anomaly Detection
For systems with service dependencies or topologies (e.g., service meshes)

Use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or spectral analysis
