From Denormalization to Joins: Why ClickHouse Cannot Keep Up
The biggest disadvantage of denormalizing tables in ClickHouse is the increased difficulty and cost of handling data updates and maintaining data consistency. Because ClickHouse is a columnar, append-only database, and denormalization creates redundant data, making changes requires re-writing entire, often massive, datasets, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. 


Drawbacks of denormalizing tables in ClickHouse
Costly and complex data updates: Unlike traditional databases that can perform efficient row-level updates,
ClickHouse is optimized for high-volume, append-only writes. A denormalized table with redundant data is difficult to update.
For example, if a customer's name changes, a denormalized table would require updating that name across every single order placed by that customer. In ClickHouse, this means you must rewrite or mutate all affected rows, which is a slow and resource-heavy operation.
Risk of data inconsistency: When data is duplicated across a denormalized table, there is a higher risk of inconsistency. 
If an update fails to propagate to all redundant instances of a data point, the dataset becomes unreliable.
This makes maintaining data integrity a more challenging and manual process compared to a normalized schema.

Bloated storage and less effective compression: While ClickHouse's columnar storage and compression are efficient,
denormalization adds redundant data, increasing the overall storage footprint. 
For example, storing a long product name hundreds of times for different orders is less efficient than storing a single product ID and 
looking up the name from a smaller table. This bloating can reduce the effectiveness of ClickHouse's compression algorithms, 
which work best on columns with many similar or repetitive values.
Potential for slower queries on wide tables: Denormalized tables are often "wide," containing a large number of columns. 
While ClickHouse can be faster by avoiding joins, a query that only needs a few columns may be slower on a very wide table. 
This is because wider rows result in larger data parts, which must be read from disk, even if only a few columns are used in the query.
Infrequent updates and complex ETL: Denormalization shifts the complexity from query time to ingestion time. 
To handle data that changes, you must either tolerate some data staleness or build complex Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines
to process and re-ingest data. This can make real-time denormalization unrealistic,
as a single source table change could trigger updates across many rows in a denormalized table. 

Preferred alternatives in ClickHouse
Instead of relying on denormalization, ClickHouse provides powerful, native features that offer superior performance and maintain data integrity. These include: 
Materialized views: These can pre-aggregate or pre-join data automatically as new data is ingested, reducing the need for denormalized tables.
Dictionary tables: For dimension tables that are small and frequently accessed, dictionaries provide lightning-fast, in-memory lookups, completely avoiding joins in queries.
Nested data structures: ClickHouse supports complex data types like Nested and Array, which can store one-to-many relationships within a single row without the redundancy of a flat denormalized table.
Projections: This feature allows you to define alternative data layouts for a table. ClickHouse automatically selects the right projection to speed up a query without you having to manage a separate, denormalized table.
