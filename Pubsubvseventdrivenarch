Is event driven architecture different than publisher subscriber
Yes, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and the Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern are related but not the same. Here's how they differ:


---

1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

Architecture style that revolves around the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events.

Events are first-class citizens â€” any significant change in state (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "PaymentFailed").

Components are loosely coupled and interact through events.

Supports various communication models:

Pub/Sub (asynchronous broadcast)

Event Streaming (Kafka, Pulsar)

Event Sourcing

CQRS




---

2. Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

A messaging pattern, often used within EDA.

Involves:

Publisher: emits messages/events.

Subscriber: consumes messages/events.


Usually facilitated by a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis).

Subscribers don't directly know about publishers, enabling loose coupling.

Summary of Differences:

Feature	Event-Driven Architecture	Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

Scope	Architectural style	Messaging pattern
Focus	Event generation and handling	Message distribution
Use cases	System-wide integration	Component-to-component communication
Includes Pub/Sub?	Yes, as one implementation pattern	No, it's a standalone pattern
Example Technologies	Kafka, AWS EventBridge, Azure Event Grid	Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub



---

So, Pub/Sub is a pattern used inside EDA, but EDA is a broader architectural approach that may use Pub/Sub, but also includes other patterns and responsibilities like orchestration, event processing, and storage.
