In a transaction , there can be multiple reads and writes.
Transaction can be called a step by step process of reads writes deletes updtes like  CRUD


In the context of database management systems, isolation levels define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions. The goal is to balance data consistency with performance and concurrency.


üîí ACID "I" ‚Äì Isolation
Isolation is the "I" in ACID, and different isolation levels control how/when the changes made by one transaction become visible to others.

üîÑ Read Phenomena
Isolation levels are defined based on which of these undesirable phenomena are allowed:

Phenomenon

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dirty Read**          | A transaction reads uncommitted changes made by another transaction.                                   |
| **Non-Repeatable Read** | A row read twice within a transaction gives different results because another transaction modified it. |
| **Phantom Read**        | New rows added by another transaction are visible in a repeated query.                                 |

üõ† DBMS-Specific Notes
MySQL (InnoDB): Default is REPEATABLE READ. Phantom reads are avoided using Next-Key Locks.

PostgreSQL: Uses MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control), making READ COMMITTED safe without blocking.

SQL Server: Defaults to READ COMMITTED; also supports Snapshot Isolation.

Oracle: Uses READ COMMITTED by default with non-blocking reads using versioning (similar to MVCC).


Snapshot Isolation:

Snapshot Isolation (SI) is a database isolation level that provides consistent reads without blocking writers,
and vice versa, using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).

üî∑ What is Snapshot Isolation?
Snapshot Isolation ensures that:

Each transaction reads data from a consistent snapshot (i.e., the state of the database when the transaction started).

Changes made by concurrent uncommitted transactions are not visible.

No read locks are acquired, so reads don't block writes and vice versa.

Write-write conflicts are detected at commit time.



üîß Example
Assume two transactions run concurrently:

T1:

START TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM account WHERE id = 1; -- reads balance = 100
-- some processing...
UPDATE account SET balance = 90 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;


T2:

START TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM account WHERE id = 1; -- reads balance = 100
-- some processing...
UPDATE account SET balance = 80 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT; -- ‚ùå Conflict! Write-write conflict with T1


üß† Key Properties

| Property             | Supported by SI  |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Consistent read view | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Dirty reads          | ‚ùå No             |
| Non-repeatable reads | ‚ùå No             |
| Phantom reads        | ‚ùå No (partially) |
| Write skew anomaly   | ‚ùå May occur      |


Snapshot Isolation is stronger than Read Committed but weaker than Serializable.

‚ö†Ô∏è Write Skew Anomaly Example
Two doctors, D1 and D2, must not go off-call simultaneously:

-- Initial: D1 = on-call, D2 = on-call

T1:                          T2:
SELECT status(D2);          SELECT status(D1);  -- both see "on-call"
UPDATE D1 SET off-call;     UPDATE D2 SET off-call;
COMMIT;                     COMMIT;


‚û°Ô∏è Now both are off-call, violating a constraint, even though they both saw consistent snapshots.

üìå Where It‚Äôs Used
PostgreSQL (REPEATABLE READ implements Snapshot Isolation)

SQL Server (SNAPSHOT isolation level)

Oracle (default uses SI-like mechanism)

MySQL (InnoDB) uses MVCC, similar to SI but defaults to REPEATABLE READ with different semantics



‚úÖ Pros
High performance for read-heavy workloads

No read locks: better concurrency

No dirty reads or non-repeatable reads
‚ùå Cons
Doesn‚Äôt prevent write skew anomalies

More memory/IO overhead (stores older row versions)

Conflict detection at commit time may lead to retries

Snapshot Isolation (SI) and Serializable Isolation are two high-level database isolation strategies that aim to maintain data consistency during concurrent transactions. While both prevent common anomalies like dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, they differ in implementation, performance, and the types of anomalies they can prevent.

üîç Snapshot Isolation (SI)
Mechanism: Utilizes Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to provide each transaction with a consistent snapshot of the database at the start of the transaction.

Key Characteristics:

Read Consistency: Transactions read data as it existed at the start time, ignoring concurrent modifications.

No Read Locks: Readers don't block writers and vice versa, enhancing concurrency.

Write Conflicts: If two transactions modify the same data, the one that commits second will fail.
Wikipedia

Pros:

High concurrency due to non-blocking reads.

Avoids common anomalies like dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.

Cons:

Susceptible to write skew anomalies, where concurrent transactions read overlapping data and make disjoint updates, leading to inconsistent states.

üîí Serializable Isolation
Mechanism: Ensures that transactions execute in a manner equivalent to some serial (one after another) order, typically using locks.

Key Characteristics:

Strict Consistency: Prevents all concurrency anomalies, including phantom reads and write skew.

Locking: Employs read and write locks, holding them until the transaction completes.

Reduced Concurrency: Transactions may block each other, leading to potential deadlocks.

Pros:

Provides the highest level of isolation and consistency.

Suitable for applications requiring strict data integrity.

Cons:

Lower concurrency due to blocking.

Potential for deadlocks and increased resource contention.

üìù Example Scenario: Write Skew Anomaly
Consider a hospital system where two doctors, Dr. A and Dr. B, must not be off-duty simultaneously. The rule is enforced by ensuring at least one doctor is on duty at any time.

Under Snapshot Isolation:

Dr. A checks that Dr. B is on duty and decides to go off-duty.

Simultaneously, Dr. B checks that Dr. A is on duty and decides to go off-duty.

Both transactions commit, resulting in both doctors being off-duty, violating the constraint.

Under Serializable Isolation:

The system would prevent this anomaly by ensuring that one transaction sees the other's update, thus maintaining the constraint.

üèÅ Conclusion
While both Snapshot and Serializable isolation levels aim to maintain data consistency, they cater to different needs:

Snapshot Isolation is suitable for applications that prioritize performance and can tolerate certain anomalies.

Serializable Isolation is ideal for applications where strict data integrity is paramount, despite potential performance trade-offs.

Understanding the specific requirements and constraints of your application will guide the choice between these isolation levels.
