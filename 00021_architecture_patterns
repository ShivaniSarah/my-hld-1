Layered Architecture  (eg, MVC, MVT, MVP)
Monolithic or Modular 
Microservices
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
Event Driven Architecture (CQRS, webhook)




üî∑ 1. Layered (n-Tier) Architecture
Definition: Application is organized into layers (typically: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access, and Database).
Use Case: Enterprise applications, web applications.
Example:
Java Spring Boot applications.

ASP.NET MVC.

Pros:
Separation of concerns.

Easy to test and maintain.

Cons:
Tightly coupled layers can make changes slower.

Not ideal for high-performance or real-time systems.

üî∑ 2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Definition: Components communicate via events (messages or signals).
Use Case: Asynchronous systems, IoT, microservices, real-time data.
Example:
Kafka-based microservices.

AWS Lambda functions triggered by SQS or EventBridge.

Pros:
Loose coupling.

High scalability and responsiveness.

Cons:
Complex debugging and tracing.

Requires careful event schema/versioning.

üî∑ 3. Microservices Architecture
Definition: Application is split into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
Use Case: Large-scale systems requiring flexibility and scalability.
Example:
Netflix, Amazon, Uber.

Pros:
Independent development, deployment, and scaling.

Better fault isolation.

Cons:
Operational complexity.

Requires distributed system management.

üî∑ 4. Monolithic Architecture
Definition: Entire application is built and deployed as a single unit.
Use Case: Small or early-stage applications.
Example:
Django, Ruby on Rails apps.

Traditional LAMP stack websites.

Pros:
Simple to build and deploy.

Easier debugging for small teams.

Cons:
Hard to scale and maintain as app grows.

Single point of failure.

üî∑ 5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Definition: Similar to microservices but with services sharing more enterprise-wide resources and standardized contracts (like WSDL for SOAP).
Use Case: Enterprise integrations, ERP systems.
Example:
Oracle SOA Suite.

IBM WebSphere.

Pros:
Promotes reuse.

Well-suited for large enterprise systems.

Cons:
Often heavyweight.

Performance overhead due to XML/SOAP.

üî∑ 6. Serverless Architecture
Definition: Application logic is deployed as functions in the cloud, and the infrastructure is managed by the provider.
Use Case: Event-driven apps, lightweight APIs, automation tasks.
Example:
AWS Lambda.

Azure Functions.

Google Cloud Functions.

Pros:
No server management.

Auto-scaling.

Cons:
Cold start latency.

Limited runtime execution time.

üî∑ 7. Client-Server Architecture
Definition: Client makes requests to a centralized server for data or resources.
Use Case: Web applications, mobile apps.
Example:
Browsers talking to web servers.

Android/iOS apps communicating with REST APIs.

Pros:
Centralized control and security.

Easy to maintain data consistency.

Cons:
Server becomes a bottleneck or single point of failure.

üî∑ 8. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
Definition: Each node acts as both a client and server.
Use Case: File sharing, blockchain, decentralized systems.
Example:
BitTorrent.

Bitcoin network.

Pros:
Highly scalable and fault-tolerant.

No centralized control.

Cons:
Harder to manage and secure.

Data consistency challenges.

üî∑ 9. Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture
Definition: Core logic is independent of external systems. Adapters handle communication.
Use Case: Applications that need to be technology-agnostic and easily testable.
Example:
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects.

Pros:
Highly testable and maintainable.

Loose coupling between domain and infrastructure.

Cons:
Steeper learning curve.

More boilerplate code.

üî∑ 10. Component-Based Architecture
Definition: Application is built using reusable, modular components.
Use Case: UI-heavy applications, front-end frameworks.
Example:
React, Angular, Vue.js.

Component libraries in Design Systems (e.g., Material UI).

Pros:
Reusability and scalability.

Consistent UI/UX.

Cons:
Initial overhead in setup.

Risk of component overengineering.

‚úÖ 1. Microkernel Architecture (a.k.a. Plugin Architecture)
üß© Definition:
A core system (microkernel) provides minimal functionality, and additional features are implemented as plugins or modules. The core handles basic services, and extensions can be loaded dynamically.

üõ†Ô∏è Structure:
Core System ‚Äì Manages communication, resource management.

Plugins / Modules ‚Äì Add or enhance features without modifying the core.

üìò Example:
Eclipse IDE ‚Äì core handles UI and plugin system; everything else is added as plugins.

Operating Systems like Mac OS/X or Windows, where drivers or features are modular.

‚úÖ Pros:
High flexibility and extensibility.

Isolates core logic from optional features.

Better fault isolation.

‚ùå Cons:
Communication overhead between core and plugins.

Plugin compatibility and versioning challenges.

üîÑ Use Case:
IDEs, extensible software platforms, OS kernels.

‚úÖ 2. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ‚Äì Communication Pattern (Not an Architecture by itself)
üß© Definition:
RPC is a communication protocol that allows a program to cause a subroutine to execute on another address space (e.g., on another computer/server) as if it were local.

RPC enables distributed systems architectures such as Microservices or Client-Server.

üõ†Ô∏è Examples:
gRPC (Google RPC) ‚Äì widely used with Protobuf.

Apache Thrift, JSON-RPC, XML-RPC.

REST can be considered a form of "resource-oriented RPC" (less formal).

‚úÖ Pros:
Abstracts network communication.

Allows distributed computing in a seamless way.

‚ùå Cons:
Tight coupling unless well-designed.

Debugging is hard; failure-prone due to network issues.

üîÑ Use Case:
Microservices communicating over gRPC.

Backend systems with high-performance service-to-service calls.


| Concept         | Type                  | Purpose                                     | Example               |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Microkernel** | Architecture Pattern  | Modular core + plugins                      | Eclipse, OS kernels   |
| **RPC**         | Communication Pattern | Remote service calls in distributed systems | gRPC, Thrift, XML-RPC |


üîÑ Relationship to Architecture:

Microkernel is a full architecture pattern, especially for extensible apps.

RPC is a communication strategy that supports architecture like Microservices, SOA, and Client-Server.

9. Pipe and Filter Architecture

Concept: Data flows through a sequence of processing components (filters), connected by pipes.

Use cases: Compilers, data processing pipelines, ETL tools

Pros: Reusability, parallel processing

Cons: Difficult error handling, latency between stages
