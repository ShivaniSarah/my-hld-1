Serverless architecture allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying servers, paying only for the compute time used, not for idle servers. This is achieved through Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) providers like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, which execute code in response to events. Examples include creating image thumbnails from uploads, processing video data, building APIs, automating CI/CD pipelines, and running scheduled tasks.
 
What is Serverless Architecture?
In a serverless model, the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure, automatic scaling, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic as discrete functions. These functions are triggered by events, such as an API request, a file upload, or a scheduled event. 
How it Works
1. Event Trigger:
An event occurs, like a user uploading an image to a storage bucket. 
2. Function Invocation:
The event triggers a pre-defined serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), which runs on demand. 
3. Code Execution:
The function executes the necessary code to process the event, such as generating a thumbnail. 
4. Scaling & Pay-per-use:
The infrastructure scales automatically based on demand, and you only pay for the compute time the function uses. 
Examples of Serverless Architecture
Image Processing: When a user uploads an image, a serverless function can automatically create a thumbnail or other resized versions and store them, triggering further functions for metadata extraction. 
Building APIs: Creating RESTful APIs to handle requests from web or mobile applications. 
Asynchronous Processing: Processing large files, such as transcoding video into different formats without requiring constant server resources. 
Scheduled Tasks: Running daily reports, performing database backups, or executing other automated business logic on a regular schedule. 
CI/CD Pipelines: Automating the build, test, and deployment process for microservices. 
Chatbots: Developing chatbots that handle user queries and respond to messages without a continuously running server. 
IoT Applications: Processing data and responding to events from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in near real-time.
