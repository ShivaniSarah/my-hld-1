Caching solves:

Avoid network calls
Avoid repeated computataions
Avoid DB load

Why cant store everything in cache?
hardware of cache is SSD costly
also if store tons a data , search time will increase why dont we go and hit the database.


So we need to keep only the relevant data in cache
to do so , we need cache policy to load and evict data
And cache performance entirely depends on cache policy

eviction policy
LRU
LFU

Poor  eviction policy increases the DB calls
With small cache , cache Thrashing: you are inputting and outputting the elements without using it, it is hurtful situation for cache.

cache write policy

write through
write back

for write through -> might have cache invalidated in other servers

so can keep global cache

write back is expensive
