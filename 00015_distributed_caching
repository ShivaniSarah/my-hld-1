Caching solves:

Avoid network calls
Avoid repeated computataions
Avoid DB load

Why cant store everything in cache?
hardware of cache is SSD costly
also if store tons a data , search time will increase why dont we go and hit the database.


So we need to keep only the relevant data in cache
to do so , we need cache policy to load and evict data
And cache performance entirely depends on cache policy
LRU
LFU
