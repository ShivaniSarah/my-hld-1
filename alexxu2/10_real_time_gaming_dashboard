10 Real-time Gaming Leaderboard

We are designing a leaderboard system for an online mobile game where users earn points when they win matches. The leaderboard ranks players in real time based on their scores.

Step 1 - Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope

Leaderboards may sound simple but come with complexities when we scale them to millions of users and require real-time updates. Let’s walk through the clarifications made between the candidate and the interviewer.

Key Clarifications

How is the score calculated?

Players get 1 point for each match won.

Each user has a score that increments when they win.

Are all players included?

Yes, every player in the tournament is included.

Time segmentation?

Each tournament lasts one month. At the start of each new month, a new leaderboard is created.

Do we only care about top 10 users?

Primarily yes.

Must display top 10 users + specific user rank.

Bonus: Show players 4 places above and below the specific user.

How many users in a tournament?

About 5M DAU (Daily Active Users).

25M MAU (Monthly Active Users).

How many matches are played?

Each user plays ~10 matches per day.

Ranking for same score?

If two players have the same score → they share the same rank.

Real-time requirement?

Yes. Must update scores and leaderboard immediately (not batch processed).

Functional Requirements

Display top 10 players.

Show a user’s specific rank.

Display 4 players above and below a given user (bonus).

Non-Functional Requirements

Real-time updates (score reflected instantly).

High scalability (millions of users).

High availability and reliability.

Back-of-the-envelope Estimation

These calculations help us understand the scale of the problem.

Daily Active Users (DAU): 5M.

Evenly distributed → ~50 users/sec.

But usage is not uniform → assume 5x peak load → ~250 users/sec.

QPS (Queries Per Second) for scoring points:

Each user plays 10 games/day → 50 × 10 = 500 QPS average.

Peak load = 500 × 5 = 2,500 QPS.

QPS for fetching top 10 leaderboard:

Assume leaderboard loaded once/day/user → ~50 QPS.

So the system must support:

2,500 QPS for score updates.

50 QPS for leaderboard fetch.

Step 2 - Propose High-level Design and Get Buy-in

Now that requirements are clear, let’s design APIs, high-level architecture, and data models.

API Design

We need 3 core APIs:

1. POST /v1/scores

Updates a user’s score when they win a match.

Request Parameters


| Field    | Description                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| user\_id | The user who wins a game.           |
| points   | Number of points gained (e.g., +1). |



Response


| Status Code     | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 200 OK          | Successfully updated user’s score. |
| 400 Bad Request | Failed to update user’s score.     |




⚠️ Note: This is an internal API, only callable by game servers (not directly by clients).

2. GET /v1/scores

Fetch the top 10 players from the leaderboard.


Sample Response:


{
  "data": [
    {
      "user_id": "user_id1",
      "user_name": "alice",
      "rank": 1,
      "score": 976
    },
    {
      "user_id": "user_id2",
      "user_name": "bob",
      "rank": 2,
      "score": 965
    }
  ],
  "total": 10
}


3. GET /v1/scores/{user_id}

Fetch the rank of a specific user.

Request Parameter

Field	Description
user_id	ID of the user whose rank we want.

Sample Response:

{
  "user_info": {
    "user_id": "user5",
    "score": 940,
    "rank": 6
  }
}



✅ With these APIs:

Players’ scores are updated in real-time.

The system supports fetching leaderboards (top 10 + specific ranks).

Additional features like 4-above, 4-below user can be extended later.

High-level architecture

The high-level design (Figure 10.2) consists of two core services:

Game service: Handles game logic and validates wins.

Leaderboard service: Updates and fetches leaderboard data from the leaderboard store.

Workflow:

Player wins a game → client sends request to the game service.

Game service validates the win → calls the leaderboard service to update score.

Leaderboard service updates user score in the leaderboard store.

Player fetches leaderboard data directly from the leaderboard service, including:

Top 10 leaderboard.

Player’s own rank.

This separation ensures secure score updates and fast leaderboard lookups.

Should the client talk to the leaderboard service directly?

Two options were considered (Figure 10.3):

Current option (server authoritative):

Client reports game win → game service validates → leaderboard service updates score.

More secure because only server sets the score.

Alternative option (client sets score):

Client sends score directly to leaderboard service.

Problem: Insecure — vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where players could proxy requests and manipulate scores.

👉 Decision: The score must always be set server-side.

Note on server authoritative games:

For games like online poker, the game server itself already knows the outcome. In such cases, the client doesn’t even need to call the game service to set the score — the game server updates scores automatically.

Do we need a message queue between the game service and the leaderboard service?

The decision depends on how game scores are used:

Current design (no queue):

Direct communication → game service → leaderboard service.

Chosen because no explicit requirement for extra consumers.

Alternative with a message queue (e.g., Kafka) (Figure 10.4):

Game service pushes score events to Kafka.

Multiple consumers can process events:

Leaderboard service (updates scores).

Analytics service (tracks player stats).

Push notification service (alerts other players).

Useful for turn-based/multiplayer games where real-time notifications are needed.

👉 Since the interview scenario didn’t require these extra consumers, a message queue wasn’t included.

Data models

The leaderboard store is a key system component. Three potential storage solutions were evaluated:

Relational database (RDS) → simplest approach (discussed here).

Redis → optimized for ranking queries (discussed later).

NoSQL → covered in deep dive (page 309 in original).

Relational database solution

If the scale is small (few users), a relational DB is sufficient.

Schema:

Leaderboard Table (Figure 10.5):

user_id (varchar)

score (int)

(In reality, additional fields like game_id, timestamp, etc., would exist, but basic logic remains the same.)

Workflow:
1. A user wins a point (Figure 10.6):

Insert if new:

INSERT INTO leaderboard (user_id, score) VALUES ('mary1934', 1);


Update if exists:

UPDATE leaderboard SET score = score + 1 WHERE user_id = 'mary1934';

2. Find a user’s leaderboard position (Figure 10.7):

Sort entire leaderboard by score in descending order:

SELECT (@rownum := @rownum + 1) AS rank, user_id, score
FROM leaderboard
ORDER BY score DESC;


Example result (Table 10.4):


| rank | user\_id      | score |
| ---- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1    | happy\_tomato | 987   |
| 2    | mallow        | 902   |
| 3    | smith         | 870   |
| 4    | mary1934      | 85    |


Why this doesn’t scale well:

Sorting problem: To find a user’s rank, the DB must sort the entire table (millions of rows possible).

Real-time requirement: Sorting millions of rows takes seconds — unacceptable for real-time leaderboards.

Caching not feasible: Data changes continuously, so caching ranks isn’t reliable.

High read load: Players frequently check ranks → heavy query load on RDS.

👉 RDS is only viable for batch jobs (e.g., daily ranking updates), but not for real-time leaderboards.

Optimization attempt (LIMIT with index):

Query for top 10 players only:


SELECT (@rownum := @rownum + 1) AS rank, user_id, score
FROM leaderboard
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;




Issue: Works for top 10, but not scalable for finding arbitrary player ranks.

To find rank of a mid/low-ranked player → still requires scanning/sorting entire table.

Conclusion

Game → Leaderboard flow must be server-authoritative (client can’t set scores).

Message queues are only needed if score events are consumed by multiple services (analytics, notifications, etc.).

Relational DB is fine for small-scale leaderboards, but fails at scale due to slow ranking queries and high load.

For real-time, large-scale leaderboards, more specialized solutions (like Redis Sorted Sets or NoSQL) are needed.


Redis Solution

We want a solution that gives predictable performance even for millions of users and provides easy access to common leaderboard operations without relying on complex database queries.

Redis provides such a solution because it is:

In-memory → extremely fast reads and writes.

Supports Sorted Sets → a special data type that perfectly fits leaderboard design.

What Are Sorted Sets?

A sorted set in Redis is:

Similar to a set: each member must be unique.

Each member is associated with a score.

Sorting is based on the score (ascending by default).

Scores may repeat, but members cannot.

Leaderboard Mapping

A leaderboard maps perfectly to a sorted set:

User → Member

User score → Score

Internal Implementation

Redis sorted sets use two data structures internally:

Hash table → maps users to scores.

Skip list → maps scores to users.

Thus:

Users are sorted by scores automatically.

Insertions and updates place them in the correct position immediately.

Example Representation

A leaderboard looks like a table:

leaderboard_feb_2021


| score | member  |
| ----- | ------- |
| 99    | user10  |
| 97    | user20  |
| 94    | user105 |
| 92    | user45  |
| 90    | user7   |
| 86    | user101 |
| 83    | user9   |
| 82    | user302 |
| 79    | user309 |
| 72    | user200 |


Users are always sorted by score descending.

Skip List

A skip list is the underlying data structure that enables fast operations.

Base Case

At its simplest, a skip list is a sorted singly-linked list.

Searching, inserting, and removing would normally be O(n).

Speedup Idea

Add multi-level indexes that skip over nodes, similar to binary search.

Level 1 index → skips every other node.

Level 2 index → skips every other node from level 1.

Continue adding levels until the jump distance is between ½ and 1.

Example

Searching for number 45 in a skip list is much faster with multi-level indexes.

Instead of traversing every node, we “jump” using the indexes.

Large Example

With 5 levels of indexes, finding a node might take only 1 traversal instead of 62.

Performance Comparison

Sorted sets ensure each element is auto-positioned on insert or update.

Complexity:

Insert (ZADD), Update (ZINCRBY), Find rank (ZRANK) → O(log n)

Relational DB alternative → expensive query with nested counts:


SELECT *, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM leaderboard lb2 
        WHERE lb2.score >= lb1.score) AS RANK
FROM leaderboard lb1
WHERE lb1.user_id = {:user_id};
This is slow for large datasets.

Implementation Using Redis Sorted Sets
Redis provides efficient commands for leaderboards:

1. ZADD
Inserts or updates a user’s score.

Complexity: O(log n)

2. ZINCRBY
Increments a user’s score by a given value.

If user does not exist → starts from 0.

Complexity: O(log n)

3. ZRANGE / ZREVRANGE
Fetch a range of users sorted by score.

Can specify:

Ascending (ZRANGE) or Descending (ZREVRANGE)

Start index, end index

Number of entries

Complexity: O(log n + m)

m = number of entries fetched (usually small).

4. ZRANK / ZREVRANK
Fetch a user’s position in ascending or descending order.

Complexity: O(log n)

Workflow With Sorted Sets
1. A User Scores a Point
Each month → a new leaderboard sorted set is created.

Old leaderboards → moved to historical storage.

When a user scores, call ZINCRBY.

Example:

redis
Copy code
ZINCRBY leaderboard_feb_2021 1 "mary1934"
→ Adds 1 point to mary1934.

2. A User Fetches the Top 10 Global Leaderboard
Use ZREVRANGE (descending order).

Add WITHSCORES to fetch both usernames and scores.

Example:

redis
Copy code
ZREVRANGE leaderboard_feb_2021 0 9 WITHSCORES
Output:

css
Copy code
[(user2, score2), (user1, score1), (user5, score5), ...]
3. A User Fetches Their Leaderboard Position
Use ZREVRANK to fetch user’s rank (descending order).

Example:

redis
Copy code
ZREVRANK leaderboard_feb_2021 "mary1934"
→ Returns her current leaderboard position.

4. Fetch the Relative Position in the Leaderboard
Using sorted set queries, we can also get neighboring positions (users just above or below).

This allows us to show a user their relative ranking context, e.g., top 5 above and below them.



Fetch 4 Players Above and Below

To find the relative position of a user in the leaderboard, we can leverage Redis Sorted Sets (ZREVRANGE command).

Example: If user Mallow007 is ranked 361, and we want to fetch 4 players above and below,
we run:

ZREVRANGE leaderboard_feb_2021 357 365


This command fetches players ranked from 357 to 365, which includes 4 players above and 4 below Mallow007.

This approach makes it easy to dynamically fetch leaderboard context around any player.

Storage Requirement

To estimate storage needs, we calculate based on user IDs and scores.

Each entry stores:

User ID: 24-character string

Score: 16-bit integer (2 bytes)

Total per entry = 26 bytes

Worst case: 25 million Monthly Active Users (MAU), each with one leaderboard entry.

26 bytes × 25,000,000 = 650 million bytes (~650 MB)

Considering Redis overhead (skip list + hash for sorted set), we double the memory usage.

Still manageable within a modern Redis server.

CPU & I/O Usage

Peak QPS (queries per second) = 2500 updates/sec

This is well within Redis performance limits for a single server.

Persistence Concern

Redis nodes might fail, and restarting large Redis instances from disk is slow.

Solution:

Use Redis persistence

Configure read replica → If the main fails, promote replica to primary and attach a new replica.

Supporting Tables in Relational Database (MySQL)

Besides Redis, we need two relational tables:

User Table

Stores: user ID, display name

(In real-world apps, this would include more user details).

Point Table

Stores: user ID, score, timestamp of game won

Uses:

Tracks play history

Recreates Redis leaderboard if infrastructure fails

Optimization

Create a user detail cache for top 10 players (since they are retrieved most often).

This optimization is minor, as the data volume is small.

Step 3 – Design Deep Dive

Now that high-level design is done, we go deeper into deployment and scaling.

To Use a Cloud Provider or Not

We have two options depending on infrastructure:

Manage Our Own Services

In this approach, we set up and maintain everything ourselves.

Leaderboard data

A Redis sorted set is created each month for leaderboard data.

Stores member + score.

User details

Stored separately in MySQL databases (e.g., name, profile image).

Fetching leaderboard

API servers query Redis for scores/ranks.

Also query MySQL for user details.

Optimization if inefficient

Use user profile cache for top 10 players, so details load faster.

Architecture (Figure 10.15)

Load balancer distributes traffic to web servers.

Web servers handle requests.

Redis (sorted set) stores leaderboard data.

MySQL stores user profiles and points.

Redis user profile cache (for top 10) improves performance.


Build on the Cloud
Leveraging Cloud Infrastructures

Instead of managing servers ourselves, we can use cloud infrastructure to build the leaderboard. In this case, the design assumes we’re building on AWS (Amazon Web Services), which is a natural fit for scalability and ease of deployment.

Two major AWS technologies are central to this design:

Amazon API Gateway – defines RESTful API endpoints and routes requests to backend services.

AWS Lambda Functions – serverless compute functions that run only when invoked.

The mapping between RESTful APIs and Lambda functions is defined as follows (Table 10.5):


| APIs                        | Lambda Function            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| GET /v1/scores              | LeaderboardFetchTop10      |
| GET /v1/scores/{\:user\_id} | LeaderboardFetchPlayerRank |
| POST /v1/scores             | LeaderboardUpdateScore     |


AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform, meaning:

No servers to provision or manage.

Functions run only when triggered.

Automatic scaling with traffic.

Other cloud providers have similar offerings:

Google Cloud Functions (Google Cloud)

Azure Functions (Microsoft Azure)

In this design, the game client calls the API Gateway, which invokes the appropriate Lambda functions. These functions interact with the storage layer (Redis + MySQL) to:

Update player scores

Fetch leaderboard rankings

Return results to the API Gateway → game client

Advantages:

No need to spin up servers.

Supports auto-scaling with DAU (Daily Active Users) growth.

AWS provides Redis client support for Lambda functions.

Use Cases
Use Case 1: Scoring a Point

Player wins a game → triggers POST /v1/scores.

API Gateway calls LeaderboardUpdateScore Lambda.

Lambda updates Redis using ZINCRBY command (increment player score).

Score is stored in Redis leaderboard.

(Figure 10.16: Score a Point)

Use Case 2: Retrieving the Leaderboard

Player requests leaderboard → triggers GET /v1/scores or GET /v1/scores/{user_id}.

API Gateway calls appropriate Lambda:

LeaderboardFetchTop10 (top players).

LeaderboardFetchPlayerRank (specific player).

Lambda fetches data from Redis using ZREVRANGE (sorted set command).

Additional user details may be fetched from MySQL if needed.

(Figure 10.17: Retrieve Leaderboard)

Why Serverless?

Auto-scaling (no manual intervention).

No infrastructure management (AWS handles environment setup).

Efficient – pay only for execution time.

Recommendation: If building from scratch, use a serverless approach.

Scaling Redis

With 5M DAU (Daily Active Users):

One Redis cache is sufficient (for storage and QPS).

With 500M DAU (100× scale):

Leaderboard size grows to 65GB (650MB × 100).

QPS grows to 250,000/sec (2,500 × 100).

Requires sharding solution.

Data Sharding Approaches
1. Fixed Partition

Divide leaderboard by score ranges.

Example:

Shard 1: 1–100

Shard 2: 101–200

…

Shard 10: 901–1000

(Figure 10.18: Fixed Partition)

Key points:

Ensure even distribution of scores across shards.

Need application-level sharding logic.

User scores must be tracked → can use secondary cache (UserID → Score mapping).

When score changes → user may move to another shard.

Fetching data:

Top 10 players → query the shard with highest score range.

User rank → local rank in shard + count of users in higher shards.

2. Hash Partition (Redis Cluster)

Redis cluster automatically shards data into hash slots (16,384 slots).

Hash slot for key = CRC16(key) % 16384.

Slots distributed among Redis nodes (e.g., Node1 [0–5500], Node2 [5501–11000], Node3 [11001–16383]).

(Figure 10.19: Hash Partition)

Advantages:

Auto-sharding handled by Redis cluster.

Easy to add/remove nodes.

Challenges:

Fetching top 10 players requires scatter-gather:

Get top 10 from each shard.

Merge & sort results at application layer.

(Figure 10.20: Scatter-Gather).

Problems:

High latency for large k (top k results).

Slower with many partitions (depends on slowest shard).

Hard to determine exact user rank.

Conclusion: Fixed partition is preferable.

Sizing a Redis Node

Important considerations:

Write-heavy workloads need more memory (for snapshot persistence).

Best practice: allocate 2× memory for write-heavy apps.

Use Redis-benchmark tool to measure performance (simulates clients, measures QPS).



Alternative Solution: NoSQL

An alternative to traditional SQL-based storage is using NoSQL databases. These are especially useful when we need:

Optimized for writes → high throughput and low-latency writes.

Efficient sorting within partitions by score → so leaderboard queries can run fast.

Popular NoSQL options:

Amazon DynamoDB

Cassandra

MongoDB

In this chapter, the example focuses on DynamoDB, which is:

Fully managed (no need to maintain servers).

Highly scalable.

Reliable with consistent performance.

To support queries beyond just the primary key, DynamoDB allows Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs).

A GSI is like a different view of the same data, where you choose a new partition key and sort key.

It enables flexible access patterns.

Updated System Diagram

Redis and MySQL (previous design) are replaced by DynamoDB.

Architecture:

Leaderboard Service connects through AWS API Gateway → AWS Lambda → DynamoDB.

(Figure 10.21 illustrates this DynamoDB-based solution).

Initial Table Design (Denormalized)

We design a leaderboard for a chess game.

Table is denormalized (includes user + leaderboard info in one place).

Makes rendering leaderboards simple.

Example Table (Figure 10.22):


| Primary Key (user\_id) | score | email                                 | profile\_pic                                             | leaderboard\_name |

Problem: Scalability

As rows increase, finding the top scores requires scanning the whole table.

Inefficient at scale.

First Attempt: Partition Key + Sort Key

To improve, we try using:

Partition key = year-month (e.g., 2020-02)

Sort key = score

(Table design in Figure 10.23).

Problem: Hot Partition

DynamoDB splits data across nodes using consistent hashing.

With this design, all the data for the latest month goes into a single partition.

That partition becomes a hot partition → performance bottleneck.

Solution: Write Sharding

To avoid hot partitions:

Split data into n partitions.

Append a partition number to the partition key.

Example pattern:

game_name#{year-month#p{partition_number}}


Partition number is generated as:
user_id % n_partitions

Trade-offs

Pros: Evenly distributes writes across partitions (no single partition overloaded).

Cons: Increases read complexity.

To read data for one month, you must query all partitions.

Choosing Number of Partitions

Depends on write volume or DAU (daily active users).

Must balance between:

Even distribution of writes.

Complexity of reads.

Updated Schema with Global Secondary Index (GSI)

In the new schema (Figure 10.24):

Partition key (PK): game_name#{year-month#p{partition_number}}

Sort key: score

Other attributes: user_id, email, profile_pic

Example Table:


| Partition Key (PK) | Sort Key (score) | user\_id         | email                                 | profile\_pic                                             |

Behavior

Each partition is locally sorted by score.

Data is distributed across partitions.

Scatter-Gather Approach

Since data is split across multiple partitions:

Scatter:

Query each partition separately.

Example: fetch top 10 results from each partition.

Gather:

Application merges results from all partitions.

Sorts them to produce the final top leaderboard.

Example (Figure 10.25):

Partition 0 → top scores list.

Partition 1 → top scores list.

Partition 2 → top scores list.

Gather them → combine & sort → final leaderboard (top 10 overall).

✅ Summary of Key Points:

NoSQL (DynamoDB) is better for write-heavy, sorted leaderboard use cases.

Initial denormalized schema fails at scale (requires full table scans).

First attempt (partition by month, sort by score) causes hot partitions.

Solution: write sharding (split into multiple partitions).

Updated schema with GSI allows local sorting.

Leaderboard queries need scatter-gather (query all partitions, then merge).




Functional Requirements

We are tasked with designing a real-time game leaderboard that supports millions of Daily Active Users (DAU). The leaderboard must allow the following operations:

Display Top 10 players at any time.

Show a user’s rank in the leaderboard.

Show four players above and four players below the queried user (to give context to their ranking).

Real-time updates whenever a user’s score changes.

Scalability to handle millions of users.

Additional constraints:

5 million DAU (daily active users).

Update score QPS (queries per second) ≈ 2,500.

Support efficient score updates and rank retrieval.

Step 1 – Non-functional Requirements

Before diving into the design, we establish non-functional requirements:

Estimation – Calculate the expected scale (DAU, QPS, storage).

API Design – Define clear endpoints:

updateScore(userId, scoreDelta) → update user’s score.

getLeaderboard(topN) → get top N players (e.g., top 10).

getUserRank(userId) → get a user’s rank and context (four above and four below).

The system must support:

Real-time updates for score changes.

Low latency retrieval for leaderboard queries.

High throughput writes for score updates.

Gaming Leaderboard – Step 2: High-Level Design

We explore possible architectures.

Data Model

We need a way to store:

User IDs

Scores

Ranks

(Optionally) metadata like timestamp of latest win for tie-breaking.

Relational Database Solution

A naïve approach: Use MySQL to store userId, score.

Query leaderboard with ORDER BY score DESC.

Problem: This does not scale to millions of users and thousands of updates per second (slow writes, heavy queries).

Conclusion: Rejected for large-scale real-time leaderboards.

Redis Solution

Redis Sorted Sets (ZSETs) are a perfect fit:

Store (score, userId) pairs.

Sorted by score automatically.

Support operations:

ZADD → add/update user score.

ZRANGE → fetch top N users.

ZRANK → get user’s rank.

Advantages: Fast (O(log N)) operations, in-memory, scalable up to millions of users.

Step 3 – Scaling Beyond One Redis Instance

If the scale grows further (e.g., 500 million DAU), one Redis instance won’t be enough. We must shard/partition the leaderboard.

Deciding the Number of Partitions

More partitions → less load per partition.

But also higher complexity, since we must scatter queries across shards to build the final leaderboard.

Solution: Perform careful benchmarking to decide the optimal number of partitions.

Problem: Exact Rank Across Shards

Redis sharding makes it hard to calculate a global rank (since users are spread across shards).

Alternative: Provide percentiles instead of exact rank.

Percentile Approach

Players don’t always need the exact rank (e.g., 1,200,001).

Instead, showing percentile ranges (e.g., top 10–20%) may be more meaningful.

Implementation:

Assume score distribution is roughly the same across shards.

Run a cron job that analyzes score distribution per shard.

Cache the percentile breakpoints:

Example:

10th percentile → score < 100

20th percentile → score < 500

90th percentile → score < 6500

When queried, map user’s score → percentile ranking.

Step 4 – Wrap Up

We now have a full solution design for a scalable leaderboard.

Summary of Explored Solutions

MySQL database – too slow for millions of users → rejected.

Redis Sorted Sets – ideal for millions of DAU, real-time updates.

Scaling with Shards – use multiple Redis instances, trade-off between partitions and complexity.

Alternative NoSQL solution – could be used, but Redis is the primary choice.

Extra Topics (if time allows)
Faster Retrieval and Breaking Ties

We can improve retrieval speed and ranking accuracy by using Redis Hashes:

Faster retrieval – Store userId → userObject in a Redis Hash. This avoids hitting the database for user details when showing leaderboard.

Tie-breaking – If two users have the same score:

Store userId → timestampOfLatestWin in the hash.

When scores are equal, rank the user with the earlier timestamp higher.

System Failure Recovery

Redis clusters can fail.

Since the MySQL database logs every game result with a timestamp, we can rebuild the leaderboard if Redis crashes:

Iterate through user entries in MySQL.

Replay them into Redis using ZINCRBY.

This restores the leaderboard offline.

Chapter Summary

We designed a real-time, scalable gaming leaderboard that can handle millions of DAU:

Started with requirements and APIs.

Explored MySQL (not scalable).

Chose Redis sorted sets for efficiency.

Scaled Redis with sharding for hundreds of millions of users.

Introduced percentile-based ranking for usability.

Enhanced retrieval with Redis hashes and tie-breaking rules.

Added system failure recovery with MySQL replay.

This design balances performance, scalability, and fault tolerance, making it suitable for real-world large-scale gaming applications.
