Avoiding cascading failuresâ€”especially in distributed systems, microservices architectures, power grids, or financial systemsâ€”involves designing with resilience and fault tolerance in mind. Below are general strategies and concrete techniques for preventing cascading failures:

âœ… General Strategies
1. Isolation and Containment
Service boundaries: Use well-defined service boundaries (e.g., in microservices) to limit the blast radius of a failure.

Bulkheads: Create independent compartments (bulkheads) so a failure in one does not affect others.

E.g., separate thread pools or connections per downstream dependency.

2. Circuit Breakers
Detect repeated failures and prevent further attempts to a failing service.

Tools: Netflix Hystrix (deprecated but still referenced), Resilience4j (Java), Polly (.NET).

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
CircuitBreakerRegistry registry = CircuitBreakerRegistry.ofDefaults();
CircuitBreaker cb = registry.circuitBreaker("myService");
3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Protect downstream services from overload.

Implement token buckets or leaky bucket algorithms.

4. Timeouts and Retries with Backoff
Always set timeouts on calls to external services.

Use exponential backoff and jitter to avoid retry storms.

java
Copy
Edit
Retry retry = Retry.ofDefaults("myRetry");
Supplier<String> retryableSupplier = Retry.decorateSupplier(retry, () -> myService.call());

5. Fail-Fast and Fallbacks
Services should detect issues early and fail fast instead of hanging.

Provide fallback mechanisms (e.g., return default values, cached data).

6. Load Shedding
Drop non-critical traffic when overloaded.

Prioritize high-priority tasks.

7. Health Checks and Auto-Healing
Use readiness/liveness probes (e.g., in Kubernetes).

Automatically restart or redirect traffic from unhealthy services.

8. Redundancy and Replication
Replicate services and infrastructure components to provide redundancy.

âœ… Monitoring, Alerting & Chaos Engineering
9. Monitoring and Alerting
Monitor key metrics: latency, error rate, resource usage, queue lengths.

Set alerts for anomaly detection and trigger automation.

10. Chaos Engineering
Regularly inject failures to observe system behavior.

Tools: Chaos Monkey, LitmusChaos, Gremlin.

âœ… Domain-Specific Examples
ðŸ”Œ Power Grids
Implement protection relays, load balancing, and system islanding.

ðŸ’° Financial Systems
Use risk limits, circuit breakers in trading, and transaction rollbacks.
