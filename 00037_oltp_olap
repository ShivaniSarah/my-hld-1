Slicing allows us to isolate a single dimension of the cube, giving us a focused view of the data. 
Dicing enables more complex filtering across multiple dimensions, providing a subcube for analysis. 
Drilling Down helps us navigate from summarized data to more granular details, enriching the data analysis process.

A star schema (also known as dimen‚Äê
sional modeling [55]).
The example schema in Figure 3-9 shows a data warehouse that might be found at a
grocery retailer. At the center of the schema is a so-called fact table 
ther columns in the fact table are foreign key references to
other tables, called dimension tables. As each row in the fact table represents an event,
the dimensions represent the who, what, where, when, how, and why of the event.

A variation of this template is known as the snowflake schema, where dimensions are
further broken down into subdimensions.
