The CQRS Pattern stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations into different models, improving scalability, maintainability, and performance in complex systems.

🧠 Concept
Traditionally, applications use a single model to handle both read (query) and write (command) operations. CQRS splits this responsibility:

Command Model: Handles writes (Create, Update, Delete)

Query Model: Handles reads (Get data)

⚡ Why Use CQRS?
Separation of Concerns: Write logic and read logic can evolve independently.

Optimized Reads/Writes: Use different data models or storage for queries and commands.

Scalability: Scale reads and writes independently.

Security: Separate permissions easily (e.g., some users can read but not write).

Event Sourcing Compatibility: Often paired with Event Sourcing for full audit trails and temporal queries.

🕓 When to Use CQRS?
✅ Use CQRS when:

The domain is complex (e.g., financial systems, order management)

Read and write operations have different performance or access requirements

You want to implement event sourcing or audit logs

You're building a collaborative, real-time system with high volume

🚫 Avoid CQRS when:

The domain is simple or CRUD-based

You don't need different models or databases for reads/writes

You want to minimize complexity

🧩 Example: E-Commerce Order System
Without CQRS:
java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderService {
    public Order getOrderById(UUID id) { ... }
    public void placeOrder(Order order) { ... }
}
With CQRS:
📤 Command (Write)
java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderCommandService {
    public void placeOrder(PlaceOrderCommand cmd) {
        // Validate
        // Save to DB
        // Emit OrderPlacedEvent
    }
}
📥 Query (Read)
java
Copy
Edit
public class OrderQueryService {
    public OrderDTO getOrderById(UUID orderId) {
        // Read from denormalized read DB
    }
}
Data Flow with Event Sourcing (optional):

placeOrder() → generates OrderPlacedEvent

Event is stored

Projection updates the read model (denormalized, fast access)

⚙️ Tools/Frameworks Supporting CQRS
Axon Framework (Java)

Eventuate

Lagom (Lightbend)

MediateR (for .NET)

Kafka or RabbitMQ (for event-driven messaging)

                                              [Query API]
✅ Benefits
Separate scalability for reads/writes

Cleaner, maintainable code

Better performance for complex read models

Suitable for asynchronous and distributed systems

❌ Challenges
Increased complexity (more layers, models)

Eventual consistency (read model may lag)

Harder to implement transactional guarantees
